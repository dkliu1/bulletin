创世记记事与诱惑的开端 | Genesis & The Beginning of Temptation

耶和华神将那人安置在伊甸园，使他耕种看守。耶和华神吩咐他说：“园中各样树上的果子，你可以随意吃，只是分别善恶树上的果子，你不可吃，因为你吃的日子必定死。”
The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the LORD God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.”

耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田野一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说：“神岂是真说不许你们吃园中所有树上的果子吗？”
Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”

女人对蛇说：“园中树上的果子，我们可以吃；惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说：‘你们不可吃，也不可摸，免得你们死。’”
The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”

蛇对女人说：“你们不一定死，因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。”
“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了；又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。他们二人的眼睛就明亮了，才知道自己是赤身露体，便拿无花果树的叶子，为自己编作裙子。
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
关于过犯与诱惑的反思 | Reflections on Offense and Temptation

“你一次又一次地这样做！”一位愤怒的母亲对她14岁的儿子说，“每次我叫你不要做这做那，你总是置若罔闻，照样做坏事。我该拿你怎么办？”
"You have done it again and again!" says an angry mother to her 14-year-old son. "Each time I ask you not to do this and not to do that, you simply ignore me and do the same bad things. What should I do with you?"

是的，当别人不断冒犯我们时，我们该怎么办？当我们不想做坏事却又重蹈覆辙时，该怎么办？当我们面临诱惑，当有人不断诱导、诱惑我们去做一些他们认为没问题、实际上却不然的事情时，我们该怎么办？
Yes, what should we do when others keep offending us? What should we do when we don’t want to do something bad, but we keep doing it? What should we do when we face temptation, when someone keeps enticing us, luring us to do something they think is okay, but in fact, it is not?

当我在迪肯大学、斯威本大学担任校牧，以及在雷文霍尔监狱担任监狱司铎时，我遇到过很多年轻人并与他们交谈。他们向我倾诉自己是如何陷入陷阱和诱惑的：作弊、抄袭、抽第一支烟、吸毒、偷窃、抢劫、杀人……所有这些罪行可能都始于一点点好奇、一点点贪婪、一点点懒惰、一点点天真或一点点愚蠢。
When I worked as a university chaplain at Deakin and then at Swinburne University, and also as a prison chaplain at Ravenhall, I met and chatted with a lot of young people. They confided to me how they fell into traps and temptations: to cheat, to do plagiarism, to smoke their first cigarette, to get into drugs, to steal, to rob, to kill... All these crimes may have started with just a little curiosity, a little greed, a little laziness, a little naivety, or a little stupidity.

圣经雅各书1:13-15说：“人被试探，不可说：‘我是被神试探’；因为神不能被恶试探，他也不试探人。但各人被试探，乃是被自己的私欲牵引、诱惑的。私欲既怀了胎，就生出罪来；罪既长成，就生出死来。”
James 1:13-15: "When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death."
责任与借口 | Responsibility and Excuses

那么，当我们闯红灯时，该怪谁呢？当我们在网上赌博输掉家产时，该怪谁呢？当我们犯奸淫并以离婚告终时，该怪谁呢？
So whom should we blame when we run a red light? Whom should we blame when we lose a fortune on some online gambling? Whom should we blame when we commit adultery and end up with a divorce?

当亚当夏娃得罪神被发现时，夏娃归咎于蛇，亚当归咎于夏娃。亚当说这不是我的错，是夏娃叫我做的；夏娃说这不是我的错，是蛇叫我做的。蛇说：“是的，我很诡诈，我很邪恶，我喜欢夺走神给人的祝福，我喜欢让人感到羞耻，我喜欢让人躲避神而不是亲近神……是的，我有重重问题，但听从我是你的问题，是你自己的私欲给自己带来了麻烦，而不是我！”
When sinned against God and being caught, Eve blamed the serpent. Adam blamed Eve. Adam said, "It is not my fault, Eve asked me to do it." Eve said, "It is not my fault, the serpent asked me to do it." The serpent said, "Yes, I am crafty, I am wicked, I like to take people away from God’s blessings, I like people to feel ashamed, I like people to avoid God instead of being close with God... yes I have a lot of problems, but it is your problem to listen to me, it is your own evil desire that caused you troubles, not me!"

夏娃和亚当的私欲是想要像神一样的贪婪和野心……像神一样知道善恶。“因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。”神禁止我们扮演神，禁止我们将自己树立为神，甚至凌驾于神之上。
The evil desire of Eve and Adam was the greed and ambition to be like God... to know good and evil as God does. "For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." God forbids us to play God, to set ourselves up as God or even above God.

于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了。夏娃吃了，亚当也吃了。他们渴望获得不属于他们的智慧，渴望知道他们本不该知道的一切。他们越过了边界，跨过了红线，超出了极限，这只能怪他们自己。亚当和夏娃的不顺服立即带来了羞耻、恐惧以及与神关系的破裂。
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. Eve ate it and Adam ate it. They desired to gain wisdom which didn't belong to them, they desired to know everything which they were not meant to know; they crossed the boundary, they moved beyond the red line, they went over the limits, they had themselves to blame. Adam and Eve’s disobedience brought immediate shame, fear, and a fractured relationship with God.
救赎的应许 | The Promise of Redemption

不顺服带来了劳苦、痛苦和死亡。然而，就在起初，我们慈爱的神就应许了一位救赎主，祂将战胜撒旦，除去我们的罪欲，带给我们最终的胜利和永恒的生命。
Disobedience brings forth toil, pain, and death. However, right at the beginning, our gracious God promised a Redeemer who will defeat Satan, remove our sinful desires, give us ultimate victory and eternal life.

罗马书5:12：“这就如罪是从一人入了世界，死又是从罪来的；于是死就临到众人，因为众人都犯了罪。……若因一人的过犯，众人都死了，何况神的恩典，与那因耶稣基督一人恩典所得的赏赐，岂不更加倍地临到众人吗？……若因一人的过犯，死就因这一人作了王，何况那些受洪恩又蒙所赐之义的，岂不更要因耶稣基督一人在生命中作王吗？……因一人的悖逆，众人成为罪人；照样，因一人的顺从，众人也就成为义了。……律法本是外添的，叫过犯显多；只是罪在哪里显多，恩典就更显多了。使罪照样作王叫人死；照样，恩典也借着义作王，叫人因我们的主耶稣基督得永生。”
Romans 5:12, 15, 17, 19-21: "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned... For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! ... For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ! ... For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. ... The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

耶稣的使命是扭转亚当的诅咒。亚当的过犯带来了审判，但因为神“丰盛的恩典”，我们的过犯却带来了神所赐的“白白的恩赐”！这恩赐是什么？就是“称义的恩典”。这就是你我作为罪人亚当的后代，如何能够被称为义（无罪释放）：凭着信心，单单仰望基督，在神面前获得公义的地位。
Jesus' mission was to reverse the curse of Adam. Adam's trespass was followed by judgment, but, because of God’s “abundance of grace,” our trespasses were and are followed by a “free gift” from God! What is this free gift? It's “the free gift of righteousness.” That's how you and I, as children of Adam the sinner, can be justified (acquitted): with a righteousness, a right-standing before God, that comes through faith alone in Christ alone.

亚当与基督之间存在着巨大的反差。我们每个人都与这两者之一相联。我们是属于亚当还是属于基督？我们拥有像亚当那样的私欲，还是拥有像耶稣那样的属神心志？
There is a huge contrast between Adam and Christ. And every one of us is identified with one of the two. Are we for Adam or for Christ? Do we have evil desire as Adam or godly desire as Jesus?

当亚当犯罪时，罪进入了世界，并从此影响了每个人的生活。在亚当犯罪之前，身体的死亡在神的世界里是未知的，但由于罪，死亡成了人类现实的一部分。
When Adam sinned, sin entered the world and has touched the life of every person from that day on. Physical death was unknown in God's world before Adam sinned, but it became very much a part of the human reality as a result.

亚当之罪的后果是每个人都必然面临死亡。不可避免地，洗净我们的罪恶和脱离死亡需要基督在十字架上的牺牲。通过耶稣的死，我们获得永生。我们这些信靠基督为救主的人，被恩待在神面前拥有公义的地位，成为神的儿女和承受产业的后嗣。因为认识基督，我们被宣告为义并拥有永生，我们可以此时此刻在地上任何环境中凯旋并作王。
The effect of Adam's sin was inevitable death for everybody. Inevitably, salvation for our sins and death requires Christ’s sacrificial death on the cross. Through Jesus’ death, we obtain eternal life. We who have trusted Christ as Savior have been graciously granted a right standing before God and have become God’s children and heirs. Because we know Christ, we've been declared right with God and we have eternal life; we can live and reign triumphantly through any circumstances right here on earth, right now.

那一天即将到来，我们将与我们的主耶稣在公义和平安中一同治理全地。提摩太后书2:12-13：“我们若能忍耐，也必和他一同作王；我们若不认他，他也必不认我们；我们纵然失信，他仍是可信的，因为他不能背乎自己。”
The day is coming when we will reign over the earth with our Lord Jesus in righteousness and peace. 2 Timothy 2:12-13: "If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we disown Him, He will also disown us; if we are faithless, He will remain faithful, for He cannot disown Himself."
恩典胜过罪 | Grace Abounds Over Sin

“因一次的过犯，审判临到了众人；因一次的义行，众人也得称为义得生命了。”虽然基督可以拯救所有人，但保罗并不是在谈论“普救论”（即无论我们是无神论者、佛教徒还是穆斯林，最终都会得救）。保罗表达得很清楚：信心是得救的唯一条件。他用了整整第四章来讨论信靠基督的重要性，因此，救赎是给所有承认并表现出对我们主耶稣基督——唯一的弥赛亚、救主和救赎者——之信心的人。
"Through one man's offense, judgment came to all men, so the free gift came to all through one Man's righteous act." All could be saved through Christ, but Paul is not talking about "universalism"—that everyone will be saved regardless of whether we are atheists, Buddhists, or Muslims. Paul has made the point very clear: Faith is the one human condition for salvation. He devoted the whole fourth chapter to talking about the importance of faith in Christ, so salvation is for all who profess and demonstrate their faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Messiah and Savior, Redeemer and Deliverer.

罗马书5:20：“只是罪在哪里显多，恩典就更显多了。”神的恩典足够巨大，可以覆盖我们所有的罪，无论这些罪多么严重。基督在十字架上的死足够深广，可以除去我们所有的罪疚，无论它看起来多么沉重。神提供了超乎丰盛的恩典，永不枯竭。
Romans 5:20: "But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more." God's grace is immense enough to cover all our sins, no matter how gross they may be. Christ's death on the cross is vast enough to remove all our guilt, no matter how overwhelming it may seem. God provides a superabundant supply of grace. It never runs dry.

罗马书5:21：“使罪照样作王叫人死；照样，恩典也借着义作王，叫人因我们的主耶稣基督得永生。”当我们信靠基督为救主，神将祂完美的义记入我们的账上时，恩典就掌权了。这保证了我们通过主耶稣基督获得永生。
Romans 5:21: "So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Grace reigns supreme when we put our faith in Christ as Savior and God credits to our account His own perfect righteousness. That assures us of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

正如亚当的罪和我们的罪必然带来死亡一样，基督在十字架上成就的大功也必然带来在神面前的义和永生。在预苦期（大斋期）的40个昼夜里，当我们为基督舍弃某些东西并承担起某些责任时，这正是我们要感谢祂的。那“某些东西”是什么？愿神亲自对我们的心说话。阿门。
Just as surely as Adam's sin brings death, Christ's finished work on the cross brings a right standing before God and eternal life. That's something to thank Him for during Lent, during the 40 days and 40 nights, when we give up something and take up something for Christ. What is that "something"? May God speak to us individually. Amen.
附录：罗马书五章精选 | Appendix: Selected Verses from Romans 5

没有律法之先，罪已经在世上；但没有律法，罪也不算罪。然而从亚当到摩西，死就作了王，连那些不与亚当犯一样罪过的，也在他的权下。亚当乃是那以后要来之人的预像。
To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.

只是过犯不如恩赐，若因一人的过犯，众人都死了，何况神的恩典，与那因耶稣基督一人恩典所得的赏赐，岂不更加倍地临到众人吗？因一人犯罪就定罪，也不如恩赐，原来审判是由一人而定罪，恩赐乃是由许多过犯而称义。
But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.

若因一人的过犯，死就因这一人作了王，何况那些受洪恩又蒙所赐之义的，岂不更要因耶稣基督一人在生命中作王吗？如此说来，因一次的过犯，众人都被定罪；照样，因一次的义行，众人也就被称义得生命了。因一人的悖逆，众人成为罪人；照样，因一人的顺从，众人也就成为义了。
For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ! Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.

律法本是外添的，叫过犯显多；只是罪在哪里显多，恩典就更显多了。使罪照样作王叫人死；照样，恩典也借着义作王，叫人因我们的主耶稣基督得永生。
The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
