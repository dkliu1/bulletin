**以弗所书 1:3-14（和合本）**

³愿颂赞归于我们主耶稣基督的父神，他在基督里曾赐给我们天上各样属灵的福气。⁴就如神从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们，使我们在他面前成为圣洁，无有瑕疵。⁵又因爱我们，就按着自己意旨所喜悦的，预定我们借着耶稣基督得儿子的名分，⁶使他荣耀的恩典得着称赞。这恩典是他在爱子里所赐给我们的。⁷我们借这爱子的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照他丰富的恩典。⁸这恩典是神用诸般智慧聪明，⁹充充足足赏给我们的，都是照他自己所预定的美意，叫我们知道他旨意的奥秘；¹⁰要照所安排的，在日期满足的时候，使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里面同归于一。¹¹我们也在他里面得了基业，这原是那位随己意行做万事的，照着他旨意所预定的，¹²叫他的荣耀，从我们这首先在基督里有盼望的人可以得着称赞。¹³你们既听见真理的道，就是那叫你们得救的福音，也信了基督，既然信他，就受了所应许的圣灵为印记。¹⁴这圣灵是我们得基业的凭据，直等到神之民被赎，使他的荣耀得着称赞。

**Ephesians 1:3-14 (NIV)**

³Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. ⁴For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love ⁵he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will— ⁶to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. ⁷In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace ⁸that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, ⁹he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, ¹⁰to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. ¹¹In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, ¹²in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. ¹³And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, ¹⁴who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.

圣诞节后第二主日，2026年第一个主日，新的教会年，新的日历年——这对我们意味着什么——充满希望和期待，我们是否对新的机会和一个接一个展开的奥秘感到兴奋，就像我们打开圣诞礼物或生日礼物一样，一个接一个，我们拆开包装纸，看看是什么，并决定我们是否喜欢它或不喜欢它，是否需要它或不需要它，以及如何处理它。

Second Sunday after Christmas, first Sunday in 2026, a new church year, a new calendar year — what does it mean to us — full of hope and expectation, are we excited with new opportunities and mysteries unfolded one by one, like we are opening the Christmas presents, or birthday presents, one by one, we unwrap the wrapping papers, see what it is, and decide whether we like it or don’t like it, whether we need it or don’t need it, and what to do with it.

我们想知道神在新的一年为我们预备了什么。我们会有任何健康问题吗，我们的家庭会怎样？我们会有更多的问题吗？还是我们会找到解决持续问题的办法。我们的教会事工会如何？我们什么时候会有新的牧师？我们需要做什么，才能在St David’s更好地取悦和荣耀神。

We wonder what God has prepared for us in the new year. Will we have any health issues, how is our family going? Will we have more problems? Or will we have the solutions to our ongoing problems. How do we do with our church ministry? When will we have a new vicar? What do we need to do, to please and honor God better at St David’s.

我们希望有一个水晶球，能清楚地看到这一年会发生什么。我们希望最好的，我们问候他人，祝愿他们幸福、健康、繁荣、成功，以及来自神圣而慷慨的神的一切可能的祝福。

We wish we would have a crystal ball and we would see clearly what will be happening in the year. We wish for the best, we greet others wishing them happiness, good health, prosperity, success and all the possible blessings from the divine and generous God.

在给<u>以弗所</u>教会的信中，<u>保罗</u>以神祝福的长篇问候语问候收信人。这个问候很长，因为它充满了祝福，从第3节一直到第14节，长达11节经文，充满了神为我们所做的一切奇妙祝福。在原文希腊文中，这是一个很长的连续句子。就好像<u>保罗</u>在赞美神时永远说不够，当他向朋友致意并问候他们从神而来的丰盛祝福时。

In the letter to the Ephesian church, Paul greeted the recipients with a long greeting of God’s blessings. The greeting is long because it is full of blessings, it is long enough from verse 3 until verse 14, 11 verses full of wonderful blessings for all that God has done for us. In the original Greek, it is one long, run-on sentence. It is almost as if Paul can never say enough when he is praising God, when he is addressing and greeting his friends with the abundant blessings from God.

<u>保罗</u>在罗马软禁期间谈到神的祝福。那是大约公元60-62年，我们不确定那时是否在<u>修殿节</u>（光明节）前后，当时<u>犹太</u>人纪念<u>马加比起义</u>后<u>耶路撒冷</u>第二圣殿的重新奉献，当时他们庆祝一个奇迹，就是圣殿<u>金灯台</u>的油燃烧了八天而不是一天。

Paul talked about God’s blessings when he was under house arrest in Rome. It was about 60-62 AD, we are not sure whether it was around Hanukkah (Festival of Lights), when the Jews commemorate the rededication of second temple in Jerusalem after the Maccabean Revolt, when they celebrate a miracle where oil for the Temple menorah candles burned for eight days instead of one.

我们也不确定，<u>保罗</u>是否在<u>犹太</u>新年<u>罗什哈沙纳</u>（意为”一年之首”）期间向<u>以弗所</u>教会致以神的祝福，这个节日纪念世界和<u>亚当</u>、<u>夏娃</u>的创造……<u>犹太</u>人以敬畏日庆祝新年，这是为期10天的自我省察和悔改时期，以<u>赎罪日</u>（Yom Kippur）结束。

We are not sure either, if Paul greeted the Ephesian church with God’s blessings during the Jewish New Year, the Rosh Hashanah, meaning the head of the year, which commemorates the creation of the world and Adam and Eve… the Jews celebrate the New Year with Days of Awe, a 10 day period of self examination and repentance, ending with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.

<u>保罗</u>的热情是在一年中的任何时候提醒任何教会的人，要记念神通过他儿子<u>耶稣基督</u>的降生所赐的祝福。<u>犹太</u>人本应该是虔诚和敬虔的，他们非常清楚赎罪的意义和必要性，因为人类的罪。

It was Paul’s passion to remind any church people, anytime of the year about the blessings of God through the birth of his son Jesus Christ. The Jewish people who are supposed to be devout and religious, well aware of the meaning and necessity of atonement because of human sins.

<u>保罗</u>需要告知和教育教会中的非<u>犹太</u>人……那些参加教会但不太了解<u>犹太</u>节期、救恩历史和基督教信仰的外邦人……这些异教徒过去有他们自己的神和女神，他们是魔法的实践者，他们生活在没有与创造天地万物和人类历史的唯一真神立约知识的情况下。

Paul needed to inform and educate the non Jewish people in the church… the gentiles who attended church but they didn’t understand too much the Jewish festivals, the Salvation history and the Christian belief…the pagans used to have their own gods and goddess, they were practitioners of magic, they lived without the covenant knowledge of the one and only one true God who creates the Heaven, the Earth, the human kind with the human history.

作为传福音者和使徒，<u>保罗</u>在第二次宣教旅程中首次短暂停留在<u>以弗所</u>，在会堂教导并承诺会回来，留下平信徒和商人<u>亚居拉</u>和<u>百基拉</u>继续基督教事工。然后他回来了（使徒行传19章），在那里待了近三年，通过在<u>推喇奴</u>学房教导，建立了一个强大的基督徒群体，帮助许多人，包括<u>犹太</u>人和外邦人成为基督徒，<u>保罗</u>任命<u>提摩太</u>为牧师，后来使徒<u>约翰</u>也帮助领导教会。

As an evangelist and apostle, Paul first stopped in Ephesus briefly on his second missionary journey, teaching in the synagogue and promising to return, leaving lay and business people Aquila and Priscilla behind to continue the Christian ministry. Then he returned (Acts 19) and spent nearly three years there, establishing a strong Christian community by teaching in a Lecture Hall of Tyrannus, helping many, including Jews and gentiles to become Christians, Paul appointed Timothy as pastor, and later the Apostle John also helped to lead the church.

很多教导，很多领导……教会并不是没有牧师，不是没有领袖，但他们没有足够谦卑和可教导的跟随者来遵循领袖和牧师的教义和基督教教导。

Lots of teachings, lots of leading… the church was not without pastors, was not without leaders but they did not have followers who were humble and teachable enough to follow the doctrinal and Christian teachings from the leaders and the pastors.

<u>保罗</u>写信给<u>以弗所</u>的教会（<u>小亚细亚</u>的一个主要城市，现在是现代土耳其），<u>以弗所</u>是罗马统治下的一个充满活力的希腊城市，知道教会仍然需要大量的教导，<u>犹太</u>和外邦信徒要在合一和圣洁中生活并不容易，<u>保罗</u>强调所有信徒都应该在充满属灵势力的异教、拜偶像文化中理解他们在基督里的新身份，<u>保罗</u>敦促基督徒要行事为人与他们的呼召相称，并坚强地抵挡邪恶，因为神如此丰盛地祝福了他们……为什么他们还要继续争斗、继续争吵、继续咬噬。

Paul wrote to the church in Ephesus (a major city in Asia Minor, now modern Turkey) Ephesus was a vibrant Greek city under Roman rule, knowing the church still need a lot of teachings, it is not easy for the Jewish and Gentile believers to live in unity and holiness, Paul stressed that all believers should understand their new identity in Christ amidst a pagan, idolatrous culture filled with spiritual forces, Paul was urging Christians to walk worthy of their calling and stand strong against evil, because God has been blessing them so much and so well… why would they keep fighting, keep barking and keep biting.

早期教会由<u>犹太</u>和外邦信徒组成，他们需要克服种族分歧，在基督里形成一个统一的身体。现今的任何教会，现代的任何基督教组织，令人遗憾的是，仍然为这个那个争论，仍然反应性地伤害和破坏在基督里的合一与和谐。我们仍然有种族差异，还有许多差异，即使我们是同一种族，但在意见和事工方式上差异太大。

The early church comprised both Jewish and Gentile believers, who needed to overcome ethnic divisions and form one unified body in Christ. Any church nowadays, any Christian organizations in the modern time, sadly, still argue over this and that, still react to hurt and destroy the unity and harmony in Christ. We still have the ethnic differences, and many differences, even if we are of the same race, but differ too much in opinions and in ways of doing ministry.

如果我能许一个新年愿望……如果我的愿望能成真，我希望没有分裂，没有对立，没有意见分歧，没有争论，没有冲突，没有争执，没有情绪爆发，没有对任何人的言语或书面攻击，没有对任何提出的事项的攻击，这些会玷污和破坏我们在基督里的合一，会消耗我们的情感，会给魔鬼留地步，会使圣灵担忧。

If I could make a New Year wish… If my wish could ever come true, I wish there is no divisions, no oppositions, no differences of opinions, no arguments, no conflicts, no disputes, no emotional outbursts, no verbal or written attacks against anyone, against any matters raised, which tarnish and damage our unity in Christ, which drain our emotions, which give the devil a foothold, which grieves the Holy Spirit.

<u>保罗</u>说，基督徒们，我们是如此蒙福。“他从创立世界以前，在基督里拣选了我们。“在世界诞生之前，在我们出生之前，我们被拣选在基督里并通过基督领受一切祝福。因为第一次降临而来的平安、喜乐、爱和盼望的祝福。当他第二次降临时，我们通过<u>耶稣</u>的审判而得到的永恒、奖赏和公义冠冕的祝福。

Paul was saying, Christians, we are so blessed. “he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.” Before the world was born, before we were born, we were chosen to receive all blessings in Christ and through Christ. The blessings of peace, joy, love and hope because of the first Advent. The blessings of eternity, award and crown of righteousness when we pass Jesus Judgement when he comes the second time at the second Advent.

<u>耶稣</u>会如何审判我们？他可能会审判：我们是否接受了他的祝福，我们是否感激他的祝福，我们是否与他人分享了他的祝福……或者当我们对他人发表评论时过于苛刻、直率、粗心时，我们可能会稀释和破坏神的祝福。

How Jesus may judge us? He may judge: whether or not we have accepted his blessings, whether or not we have appreciated his blessings, whether or not we have shared with others his blessings… or we may dilute and spoil God’s blessing when we are harsh, blunt, careless when making comments toward others.

<u>犹太</u>人是神的选民，他们被拣选是有目的的。他们被拣选成为万国的光，并祝福世界上的所有国家。

The Jews were God’s chosen people, and they were chosen for a purpose. They were chosen to be a light to the nations, and to bless all nations of the world.

同样，基督徒蒙福是为了我们可以祝福他人。我们被拣选不仅仅是为了拥有通往天堂的头等舱票，让我们排在队伍的最前面。我们必须意识到我们是蒙福的，我们是有特权的……我们是新<u>以色列</u>；我们被拣选去祝福他人，祝福教会，祝福世界。甚至祝福那些与我们非常不同的人。是的，我们不与邪恶和偶像妥协，我们不能允许异端和敌基督，我们被要求不行恶人的计谋，不站罪人的道路，不坐亵慢人的座位……

Likewise the Christians are blessed so that we may bless others. We are not chosen simply to have a first-class ticket to Heaven, and we get to be at the front of the line. We must realize that we are blessed and we are privileged… we are the new Israel; we have been chosen to bless the others, to bless the church, to bless the world. To bless even those who are very different from us. Yes we don’t compromise with evil and idols, we can’t allow heresies and anti Christ, we are asked not to walk in the counsel of the wicked, not to stand in the way of sinners, and not to sit in the seat of mockers…

我们被要求喜爱律法，喜爱主的治理、主的平安和主的合一。神的目的和神的愿望是使天上地上一切所有的，都在基督里同归于一。在基督里，我们需要温柔，而不是暴力。我们需要鼓励，而不是批评。

We are asked to delight in the law, in the governance, in the peace and the unity of the Lord. God’s purpose and God’s desire is to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. In Christ, we need to be gentle, not violent. We need to be encouraging, not critical.

所有基督徒，你和我，都被拣选去告诉别人关于<u>耶稣</u>的事，他是那被拣选的。他是那受膏者。我们并不总是做得对。但<u>耶稣</u>做得对。他是神的选民，他总是圣洁无瑕疵的。他是神的爱子，神喜悦他。他是神珍贵的产业。他是万国的光。他是<u>亚伯拉罕</u>应许的后裔。他是那位使万国万民都要因他得福的。一切祝福都从我们的救主和救赎主<u>耶稣</u>而来。没有他，一切祝福都是徒然的，一切祝福都像雾气……正如<u>雅各</u>所说……出现片时，随即就不见了（雅各书4:14）。

All Christians, you and I are chosen to tell others about Jesus, He is THE chosen one. Who is THE anointed one. We don’t always get it right. But Jesus does. He is God’s chosen one, he is always holy and blameless. He is God’s beloved, in whom God is well pleased. He is God’s treasured possession. He is the light to the nations. He is the promised descendent of Abraham. He is the one in whom all nations, all peoples, are to be blessed. All blessings flow from Jesus our Saviour and Redeemer. Without him, all blessings are in vain, all blessings are like the mist… according the St James.. appears for a little while and then vanishes (James 4:14)

我们被拣选”使他荣耀得着称赞。“神预定我们，他亲手拣选我们来赞美他，感谢他的一切创造，一切受造物，所有的男人和女人，男孩和女孩，无论他们在意识形态、神学、理论、肤色、性格、气质等方面有多么不同。

We have been chosen to live “to the praise of God’s glory.” God predestined us, he hand picked us to praise him and thank him for all his creations, all the creatures, all men and women boys and girls, no matter how different they are, in ideology, in theology, in theory, in color, in personality, in temperament etc etc..

到今晚，Rick和我，我们的长子Dietrich，他的女儿和儿子以及他怀孕的妻子Lois将飞往韩国与我们的小儿子Calvin和他的妻子Esther会面。作为一个家庭，我们是如此蒙福，我们的家庭随着姻亲、孩子、婴儿而变得越来越大……我们蒙福，但我们在做决定、制定计划、做安排时有时变得相当复杂和混乱……我们有很多事情要兼顾，我们也有很多乐趣……当我们都有正确的态度时。

By tonight Rick and I, our elder son Dietrich, his daughter and son and his expectant wife Lois will be flying to Korea meeting our younger son Calvin and his wife Esther. As a family we are so blessed, our family is getting bigger and bigger with in laws, with children, with babies… we are blessed but we are getting quite complicated and messy at times in making decisions, in making plans, in making arrangements… we have a lot to juggle, and we have a lot of fun… when we are all having the right attitude.

2026年St David’s应该有什么样的正确态度？

What should be the right attitude for St David’s in 2026?

让我祷告：全能的神，我们慈爱的父，你将你的儿子赐给我们作为我们最好的祝福。我们为新年感谢你，我们感谢你应许从年初到年终照顾你的子民。我们感谢你，我们借这爱子的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照你丰富的恩典，你充充足足地将一切祝福赏给我们。我们感谢你2025年所有已解决的问题。我们感谢你选择与我们同在，无论2026年会有多么具有挑战性。请赐给我们正确的态度、正确的方式和正确的领袖选择。奉<u>耶稣</u>的名。阿们。

Let me pray: Almighty God our gracious father who gives us your son as our best blessing. We thank you for the New Year, we thank you that you promise to care for your people from the beginning of the year to its end. We thank you that we have redemption through Jesus’ blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of your grace that you lavish all the blessings on us. We thank you for all the problems concluded in 2025. We thank you that you choose to be with us no matter how challenging 2026 will be. Please grant us the right attitude, the right manner and the right choice of leaders. In Jesus’ name. Amen.

**阿们 | Amen**
