| **Jeremiah 23:23-29 (NIV)** | **耶利米书 23:23-29（和合本）** |
| 23 “Am I only a God nearby,” declares the LORD, “and not a God far away? | 23 耶和华说：“我岂为近处的　神呢？不也为远处的　神吗？ |
| 24 Who can hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?” declares the LORD. “Do not I fill heaven and earth?” declares the LORD. | 24 耶和华说：“人岂能在隐密处藏身，使我看不见他呢？耶和华说：“我岂不充满天地吗？ |
| 25 “I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ | 25 我已听见那些先知所说的，就是托我名说的假预言，他们说：‘我作了梦！我作了梦！’ |
| 26 How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? | 26 说假预言的先知，就是先知本身存着诡诈的心，要到几时呢？ |
| 27 They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. | 27 他们各人将所作的梦对邻舍述说，想要使我的百姓忘记我的名，正如他们列祖因巴力忘记我的名一样。 |
| 28 Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. | 28 得梦的先知可以述说那梦；得我话的人可以诚实讲说我的话。糠秕怎能与麦子比较呢？这是耶和华说的。 |
| 29 “Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? | 29 耶和华说：“我的话岂不像火，又像能打碎磐石的大锤吗？ |

| **Deuteronomy 4:23-24 (NIV)** | **申命记 4:23-24（和合本）** |
| Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden. | 你们要谨慎，免得忘记耶和华你们　神与你们所立的约，为自己雕刻偶像，就是耶和华─你　神所禁止你作的偶像。 |
| For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. | 因为耶和华─你的　神乃是烈火，是忌邪的　神。 |

| **Hebrews 12:28-29 (NIV)** | **希伯来书 12:28-29（和合本）** |
| Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe, | 所以，我们既得了不能震动的国，就当感恩，照　神所喜悦的，用虔诚、敬畏的心事奉　神。 |
| for our “God is a consuming fire.” | 因为我们的　神乃是烈火。 |

| **Message Explanation (English)** | **信息讲解（中文）** |
| The consuming fire burns away impurities — a picture of God’s holiness, which cannot coexist with sin and unrighteousness. The consuming fire melts and purifies, destroys and refines. It brings judgment, but also restoration and redemption. | 烈火焚烧除去一切杂质，这是神圣洁的写照——圣洁不能与罪恶和不义共存。烈火熔化并炼净，毁坏又更新，既带来审判，也带来复兴与救赎。 |
| When a goldsmith or silversmith refines precious metals, he must melt and burn away all impurities to leave only what is pure. For sinners who are willing to be burned and refined — who repent, confess, and are willing to be transformed — God will forgive them and turn them from eternal death to eternal life, blessing upon blessing. | 当金匠或银匠炼净金银时，必须先熔化，将一切杂质焚尽，只留下纯净的部分。同样，那些愿意被烈火焚烧、被炼净的人——悔改、认罪、愿意被改变的人——神必赦免他们，使他们从永死转向永生，赐下连连不断的祝福。 |
| Jeremiah 23 brings a message of both condemnation and hope. Condemnation is for false prophets, corrupt leaders, and irresponsible shepherds who mislead God’s sheep. Hope comes in the promise of the righteous Branch — a Messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus, the sovereign King who rules with justice and righteousness. | 耶利米书 23 传递的信息，既有审判，也有盼望。审判临到假先知、败坏的领袖、失职的牧者——这些人不牧养、不保护神的羊，反而以虚假教导和错误行为使他们偏离真道。盼望则在于神应许的“公义的苗裔”——这弥赛亚的预言指向耶稣，祂是以公义治理的君王，是真牧人，必聚集分散的羊群，赐他们安全、昌盛，并将救恩带给所有人。 |
| We must not build our hope on human authorities, especially false prophets or hypocritical priests. God’s Word warns that both prophet and priest can be godless, even within the temple (Jer. 23:11). False prophets give false hope, telling people there is peace when there is none (Jer. 23:16-17). | 我们的盼望不可建基在人类的权柄上，尤其不可寄托在假先知或假冒为善的祭司身上。神的话警告我们，先知和祭司都可能悖逆，甚至在圣殿中行恶（耶 23:11）。假先知给人虚假的盼望，说“平安了”却没有平安（耶 23:16-17）。 |
| A true messenger of God speaks truth even when it is hard, giving warnings about the consequences of ignoring God’s commands, refusing to repent, and building hope on vanities instead of Christ, the solid foundation. | 真正的神仆人，即使言语难听，也会忠心传讲真理，警告人拒绝悔改、藐视神的诫命、在虚空上建立盼望的可怕后果，而不是在基督——那房角石和稳固根基——上建造。 |
| Jeremiah 23:19-22 warns that God’s wrath will come upon the wicked and false prophets. God did not send them, yet they ran with their message. God’s Word is not delusion — it is like fire and a hammer that destroys lies, purifies hearts, and shatters falsehoods. | 耶利米书 23:19-22 警告说，神的忿怒必临到恶人和假先知身上。神没有差遣他们，他们却擅自传讲。神的话不是虚幻——祂的话如火焚烧，炼净顺服的人；如大锤击碎磐石，粉碎谎言与错谬。 |
| Jesus Himself warned in Matthew 25 that many false prophets will come and deceive many. We live in dangerous times, with scams, fakes, and advanced technology capable of creating convincing lies. | 耶稣在马太福音 25 也曾预言，末世将有许多假先知起来迷惑多人。我们正活在危险的时代——有骗局、假货、以及能制造逼真谎言的高科技。 |
| Therefore, we must not be naive. We must fact-check, know Scripture, read in context, and seek God’s heart, growing in knowledge and discernment. | 因此，我们不能天真，不能盲目信任任何人，必须查验事实、查考真理、研读圣经、明白上下文、洞察神的心意，增长知识与分辨力。 |
| Jeremiah 23:28 tells us: let the prophet with a dream tell it, but the one with God’s Word must speak it faithfully. May God help all His servants to speak His Word faithfully, and may we all hear it respectfully and apply it daily — until we see Christ face to face. Amen. | 耶利米书 23:28 说：“得梦的先知可以述说那梦；得我话的人可以诚实讲说我的话。”愿神帮助所有的基督工人忠心传讲祂的话，也愿我们都恭敬聆听，将真理每日应用在生活中，直到见主的面。阿们。 |
