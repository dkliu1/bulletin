## 经文 Scripture

**路加福音 13:10-17（和合本）**

10 安息日，耶稣在会堂里教训人。  
11 有一个女人，被鬼附着，病了十八年，腰弯得一点直不起来。  
12 耶稣看见，便叫过她来，对她说：「女人，你脱离这病了！」  
13 于是用两只手按着她，她立刻直起腰来，就归荣耀与神。  
14 管会堂的，因为耶稣在安息日治病，就气忿忿对众人说：「有六日应当做工，在这六日之内可以来求医，在安息日却不可。」  
15 主说：「假冒为善的人哪，难道你们各人在安息日不解开槽上的牛驴牵去饮吗？  
16 况且这女人本是亚伯拉罕的后裔，被撒但捆绑了十八年，不当在安息日解开她的绑吗？」  
17 耶稣说这话，他的敌人都惭愧了，众人因他所行一切荣耀的事就都欢喜了。

**Luke 13:10-17 (NIV)**

10 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,  
11 and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.  
12 When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.”  
13 Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.  
14 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”  
15 The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?  
16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”  
17 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.

## 故事 Story



从前有一个少年骑车去教堂，他要在周间圣餐礼拜中担任辅祭。忽然，他看见路上有一只受伤流血的猫，就停下车，用布包扎伤口，把猫送到附近的兽医那里。  
他打电话给神父解释情况，说自己可能会迟到 10 分钟。神父回答：「没问题，你做得非常好。我会告诉会众我们稍后开始礼拜，我们等你。路上小心。」

这个故事让人想到一个词：**怜悯（compassion）**。



Once upon a time, a teenage boy was cycling to church, where he was to serve as an altar boy in a midweek Communion Service. Suddenly, he saw a cat bleeding on the road. He stopped, wrapped the cat’s wound with a piece of cloth, and took it to a nearby vet.  
The boy phoned the priest, explaining he might be ten minutes late. The priest replied: “Certainly, no problem, you are doing very well. I will announce to the congregation that we are starting later—we will wait for you. Ride carefully.”

This story brings to mind one word: **compassion**.

## 怜悯 Compassion



根据《神学辞典》，怜悯就是「与他人一同受苦」，是一种带着爱心关怀的怜惜。耶稣对受苦的群众、对有病痛、残疾、迷失的人都有怜悯。少年对受伤的猫有怜悯，神父对担心迟到的少年也有怜悯。  
怜悯往往伴随着行动和善言，是神最美的属性之一，也是基督徒最宝贵的美德之一，必蒙神喜悦与赏赐。



According to the *Wycliffe Dictionary of Theology*, compassion means “suffering with another”—pity touched with loving concern. Jesus had compassion for the neglected multitudes, for the sick, the disabled, the lost, and those without a shepherd. The teenage boy felt compassion for the injured cat, and the priest felt compassion for the boy who feared being late.  
Compassion usually comes with action and kind words. It is one of God’s greatest attributes and one of the finest Christian virtues, bringing God’s approval and reward.

## 怜悯与义怒 Compassion and Righteous Anger



怜悯有时会与义怒同在。正如主耶稣责备会堂的管辖人，因为他们对那被捆绑十八年的女人没有怜悯。邪灵的捆绑带来毁坏——身体疾病、精神痛苦、道德败坏、人与神分离、社会分裂与混乱。撒但的工作就是偷窃、杀害、毁坏，但神的怜悯带来释放和自由。



Compassion may also ally with righteous anger. Jesus rebuked the synagogue leader and others because they lacked compassion for the woman who had been bound for eighteen years. The spirit of darkness brings destruction—sickness, mental anguish, moral decay, separation from God, and social breakdown. Satan seeks chaos and division, but God’s compassion brings freedom and restoration.

## 耶稣的责备 Jesus’ Rebuke



耶稣说：「假冒为善的人哪！你们在安息日也会解开牛驴牵去饮水，何况这位亚伯拉罕的女儿，被撒但捆绑了十八年，岂不当在安息日得释放吗？」  
假冒为善的人外表敬虔，却没有真正的怜悯。他们关心牲畜的利益，却忽视人的尊严与生命。耶稣提醒我们，要尊重女人，要尊重一切照着神形象被造的人，要尊重神的子民与基督徒。



Jesus said: “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey and lead it to water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be set free on the Sabbath?”  
Hypocrites appear pious outwardly but lack compassion. They care for their animals out of economic interest, yet neglect human dignity and life. Jesus calls us to respect women, to respect all made in God’s image, to respect His covenant people and all who belong to Christ.

## 在基督里的自由 Freedom in Christ



在基督里，我们得到释放与自由。

* 约翰福音 8:36 「所以天父的儿子若叫你们自由，你们就真自由了。」
* 哥林多后书 3:17 「主就是那灵；主的灵在那里，那里就得以自由。」

没有罪疚，没有定罪，没有无根据的批评。真正的自由，就是在基督里享受平安与喜乐。



In Christ, we are set free:

* John 8:36 “So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”
* 2 Corinthians 3:17 “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”

No guilt, no condemnation, no unjust criticism. True freedom is found in Christ, with peace and joy.

**Amen.**
