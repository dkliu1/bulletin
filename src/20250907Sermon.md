愿你与人所同有的信心显出功效，使人知道你们各样善事都是为基督作的。

### 保罗为阿尼西母的代求 Paul’s Plea for Onesimus

**Philemon 1:8**  
我虽然靠着基督能放胆吩咐你合宜的事，  
Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,  

**Philemon 1:9**  
然而像我这有年纪的保罗，现在又是为基督耶稣被囚的，宁可凭着爱心求你。  
yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—  

**Philemon 1:10**  
就是为我在捆锁中所生的儿子阿尼西母求你。  
that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.  

**Philemon 1:11**  
他从前与你没有益处，但如今与你我都有益处。  
Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.  

**Philemon 1:12**  
我现在打发他亲自回你那里去，他是我心上的人。  
I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.  

**Philemon 1:13**  
我本来有意将他留下，在我为福音所受的捆锁中替你伺候我。  
I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.  

**Philemon 1:14**  
但不知道你的意思，我就不愿意这样行，叫你的善行不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心。  
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.  

**Philemon 1:15**  
他暂时离开你，或者是叫你永远得着他，  
Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—  

**Philemon 1:16**  
不再是奴仆，乃是高过奴仆，是亲爱的兄弟。在我实在是如此，何况在你呢？这也不拘是按肉体说，是按主说。  
no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.  

**Philemon 1:17**  
你若以我为同伴，就接待他，如同接待我一样。  
So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.  

**Philemon 1:18**  
他若亏负你，或欠你什么，都归在我的账上。  
If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.  

**Philemon 1:19**  
我必偿还，这都是我保罗亲笔写的。我并不用对你说，你甚至自己也是亏欠于我。  
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self.  

**Philemon 1:20**  
兄弟啊，望你使我在主里因你得快乐，并望你使我的心在基督里得畅快。  
I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.  

**Philemon 1:21**  
我写信给你，深信你必顺服，知道你所要行的，必过于我所说的。  
Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.  

**Philemon 1:22**  
此外，你还要给我预备住处，因为我盼望借着你们的祷告，必蒙恩到你们那里去。  
And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.

**Philemon 1:23**  
为基督耶稣与我同坐监的以巴弗问你安。  
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.  

**Philemon 1:24**  
与我同工的马可、亚里达古、底马、路加也都问你安。  
And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
