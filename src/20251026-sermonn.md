## 2025年10月26日
经文：Joel 2:23–32；诗篇 65；提摩太后书 4:6–8, 16–18；路加福音 18:15–30

May the words of my mouth and the meditations of all our hearts, be acceptable in your sight, O Lord our Strength and our Redeemer.
愿我口中的言语、我们心中的意念，在你面前蒙悦纳，主啊，我们的力量、我们的救赎主。

Over the course of many years in the ministry as a priest, I have been called to the bedside of people who were terminally ill.
在多年牧会的岁月中，作为一名神父，我常被召到垂危之人的床前。

And sometimes they passed away before I got there, earlier than expected, they passed into eternity.
有时我还未赶到，他们就已比预期更早地离世，进入永恒。

In our human condition, it is a time of sadness, sorrow and mourning - but for Christians it is not the end.
在人看来，那是悲伤、哀痛与哀悼的时刻——但对基督徒来说，这并非终结。

St Paul was nearing the end of his life as we see in today’s epistle reading. He was in prison knowing that he would soon die.
正如我们在今日的书信中所见，使徒保罗的生命已临近终点；他身在监牢，深知自己的死期将至。

In the second reading appointed for today, the words of St Paul to Timothy, are words of farewell.
今日第二段经文中，保罗写给提摩太的话语，是一封告别信。

Paul too was living with a ‘terminal condition’. He was on death row, awaiting execution.
保罗也身处“绝症”之中——他在死囚牢里，等待行刑。

To be a Christian in the first century was a ‘terminal condition’.
在第一世纪，成为基督徒本身就是一种“绝症”。

Your life was terminated if you refused to renounce your faith.
若你拒绝否认信仰，生命就会被终结。

This state of affairs continued into the fourth century, and persecution and martyrdom were commonplace for Christians then, and still is in many parts of the world today.
这种情形延续至第四世纪，迫害与殉道成为常态；至今，在世界许多地区依然如此。

In fact life itself is a ‘terminal condition’. No one lives for ever.
事实上，生命本身就是一种“终末状态”，没有人能永远活着。

Death is no respecter of persons, or age or nationality or race or health or wealth or status or achievements.
死亡不分身份、年龄、国籍、种族、健康、财富、地位或成就。

Death is all around us — wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, Gaza, and even in free and democratic societies like the United States.
死亡无处不在——乌克兰的战争、中东、加沙，甚至那些号称自由与民主的社会，如美国。

Death is all around us, it is a certainty for everyone who lives, it is only a matter of time before it catches up with us.
死亡环绕在我们四周，对所有活着的人都是必然，只是时间早晚而已。

How much time do I have? I haven’t the faintest clue, my next breath could be my last.
我还能活多久？我毫无所知，也许下一口气就是最后一口。

Death is the great unknown — to all human beings — most fear it, or at least regard it with awe and wonder.
死亡是人类最大的未知——大多数人惧怕它，或至少带着敬畏与惊奇看待它。

Some prefer not to think about it, while others choose to live by the axiom, “Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.”
有些人宁可不去想它，而另一些人则奉行那句格言：“吃吧，喝吧，快乐吧，因为明天我们就要死了。”

Surely there must be a better way!
难道就没有更好的方式吗？

How are we as Christians, to face this fact of human existence?
作为基督徒，我们该如何面对这一人类存在的事实？

What encouragement, or assurance can we find in the gospel and scriptures to help us?
我们能在福音与圣经中找到怎样的安慰与确据来帮助我们呢？

St Paul, in today’s epistle reading, helps us, with his faith, spiritual insights and confidence, as he faced his own imminent execution and death.
在今天的书信中，保罗以他的信心、属灵洞见与坚定信靠，帮助我们面对死亡与未知。

“…and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.”
“我现在被浇奠，我离世的时候到了。我已经打那美好的仗，跑尽了路，守住了所信的道。”（提后4:6–7）

Roman Gladiators who fought to the death in the Amphitheater would salute Caesar: “We who are about to die salute you!”
罗马斗士在竞技场上拼死战斗前，会向凯撒敬礼：“我们这些将死之人向你致敬！”

Paul uses similar imagery — but his allegiance is to Christ.
保罗也用了类似的意象，但他所效忠的是基督。

He reviews his life confidently, knowing he has lived well for the Lord.
他带着信心回顾自己的一生，确信已为主尽忠。

## Paul writes:
保罗写道：

“As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of my departure has come.”
“我现在被浇奠，我离世的时候到了。”

The Greek word ‘Spendesthai’ refers to a special sacrifice — like the final libation poured out to the gods at the end of a Roman meal.
希腊文“Spendesthai”意指“奠祭”，正如罗马人宴会结束时，将酒倒出献给神明的仪式。

Paul saw his life not being taken away, but being offered up.
保罗并不认为生命被夺去，而是主动将其献上。

Paul’s death was not meaningless — it was part of God’s greater plan to bring salvation to the Gentiles.
保罗的死并非毫无意义——它是神将救恩带给外邦人的宏伟计划的一部分。

Indeed, the blood of Paul and Peter became the seed of the Church in Rome.
的确，保罗与彼得的血成为罗马教会的种子。

As Tertullian said: “The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church.”
正如特土良所言：“殉道者的血，是教会的种子。”

Paul lived with purpose — even in death.
保罗一生充满使命感，连死亡也不例外。

He was about to exchange the confines of a Roman prison for the liberty of heaven.
他即将离开罗马牢房的囚禁，进入天国的荣耀自由。

If we must think about death, let us think of it as freedom — not defeat.
若我们必须思考死亡，就当把它看作自由，而非失败。

Paul says: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.”
保罗说：“我已经打那美好的仗，跑尽了路，守住了所信的道。”

The word “Agon” means contest — he had competed valiantly.
“Agon”意为“争战、竞赛”，他奋力战斗，忠心到底。

Where others fell away, Paul kept the faith.
当别人离弃信仰时，保罗仍坚守到底。

What a testimony: “I have kept the faith.”
多么美好的见证：“我守住了信仰。”

If we must think about death, then let us think about life — what we have done with it, and what we will yet do.
若我们要思想死亡，就让我们思想生命——我们已如何度过，又将如何使用余生。

Have we kept the faith? Then we need fear nothing.
若我们守住信仰，就无所惧怕。

Paul could see the finish line — the end was in sight, and his crown awaited him.
保罗已看见终点——结局在望，荣耀的冠冕正等着他。

“From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day — and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.”
“从此以后，有公义的冠冕为我存留，就是按公义审判的主，到那日要赐给我的；不但赐给我，也赐给凡爱慕他显现的人。”（提后4:8）

Paul’s reward is not of laurel leaves, but of righteousness — eternal and unfading.
保罗的奖赏不是月桂冠，而是公义的冠冕——永不衰残。

And this promise belongs not only to Paul, but to all who long for Christ’s appearing.
这应许不单属于保罗，也属于一切爱慕基督显现的人。

The Lord has always been with Paul — in his trials, his suffering, and his life.
主一直与保罗同在——无论在试炼、受苦或生命之中。

Paul knew the Lord would be with him as he entered His kingdom.
保罗深知，当他进入主的国度时，主必与他同在。

This is also our confidence and our hope.
这也是我们的信心与盼望。

The Lord be with you. Amen.
愿主与你们同在。阿们。
