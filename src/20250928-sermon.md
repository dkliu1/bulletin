## Personal Story 个人见证

English
Early in 1976, my first year in Australia as a theological student, I went to Canberra to visit my former parish priest, the Rev Joe Mullins in Bangalore, India.
He had retired after many years service in India and settled down in Canberra.

中文
1976年初，那是我在澳大利亚读神学的第一年，我前往堪培拉探访我在印度班加罗尔的前任堂区牧师穆林斯牧师。
他在印度服事多年后退休，定居在堪培拉。

English
I travelled to Canberra by train/bus (Yass). And there I met an old friend from my home church in Bangalore and he offered me a ride back in his car. It was an old ‘Bomb’, I think it was a Ford Valiant, with a powerful engine, and bald tires.

中文
我搭火车和巴士到堪培拉（途经 Yass）。在那里，我遇到了一位来自班加罗尔母会的老朋友，他主动提出要开车送我回去。那是一辆旧“炸弹车”，我想可能是福特勇士，发动机很强劲，但轮胎几乎磨平了。

English
As a poor theological student I grabbed the opportunity, and it turned out to be a very ‘hair raising’ ride for me.

中文
作为一个穷神学生，我当然欣然接受。然而，这一路对我来说却是惊心动魄。

## A Police Encounter 与警察的相遇

English
He drove like a maniac, several times he would go off the bitumen and on to the dirt skidding and sliding, he was trying hard to ‘impress’ me.
And I was praying desperately “O Lord, have mercy, please make this fellow ‘slow down’…”

中文
他开车就像疯了一样，好几次车子冲出柏油路滑到土路上，他似乎想用这种方式来“取悦”我。
我只好拼命祷告：“主啊，怜悯我！求你让他慢下来……”

English
Within about five minutes we were pulled up by a police car, lights flashing, siren and the works, and he was given a ticket.
I was silently praising God, “Alleluia, Praise the Lord, thank you Jesus, Amen”!

中文
大约五分钟后，一辆警车将我们拦下，灯光闪烁，警笛大作，他被开了一张罚单。
我在心里默默赞美神：“哈利路亚！赞美主！谢谢耶稣！阿们！”

## National Police Remembrance Day 全国警察纪念日

## Our Calling 我们的呼召
