登山变像 | The Transfiguration
经文引用：马太福音 17:1-9 | Matthew 17:1-9

过了六日，耶稣带着彼得、雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰暗暗地登上高山。
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.

就在他们面前变了形象，脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。
There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.

忽然，有摩西、以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣说话。
Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.

彼得对耶稣说：“主啊，我们在这里真好！你若愿意，我就在这里搭三座棚：一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”
Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”

说话之间，忽然有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们，且有声音从云彩里出来说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。你们要听他！”
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”

门徒听见，就俯伏在地，极其害怕。
When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.

耶稣进前来，摸他们，说：“起来，不要害怕。”
But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.”

他们举目不见一人，只见耶稣在那里。
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.

下山的时候，耶稣吩咐他们说：“人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。”
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”
经文引用：彼得后书 1:16-21 | 2 Peter 1:16-21

我们从前将我们主耶稣基督的大能和他降临的事告诉你们，并不是随从乖巧捏造的虚言，乃是亲眼见过他的威荣。
For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

他从父神得尊贵荣耀的时候，从极大荣光之中有声音出来向他说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。”
He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”

我们同他在圣山的时候，亲自听见这声音从天上出来。
We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.

我们并有先知更确切的预言，如同灯照在暗处。你们在这预言上留意，直等到天发亮，晨星在你们心里出现的时候，才是好的。
We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

第一要紧的，该知道经上所有的预言没有可随私意解说的；
Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things.

因为预言从来没有出于人意的，乃是人被圣灵感动，说出神的话来。
For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
默想与信息 | Reflection and Message

登山变像（记载于马太福音17章、马可福音9章、路加福音9章）揭示了耶稣的神性荣耀，证实了祂作为神儿子的身份，祂是那被选定、超越律法（摩西）和先知（以利亚）的救主。在山上，耶稣的形象改变了，神命令门徒要“听祂”，在祂钉十字架之前强化了祂的权柄。
The Transfiguration (Matthew 17, Mark 9, Luke 9) reveals Jesus's divine glory, confirming His identity as the Son of God, the chosen Savior superior to the Law (Moses) and Prophets (Elijah). On a mountain, Jesus’s appearance was transformed, and God commanded the disciples to "Listen to Him", reinforcing His authority before His crucifixion.

永恒的神，我们荣耀的君王，祢的儿子耶稣基督曾显现在选定的见证人面前。求祢赐给我们这些仆人信心，在祂里面看见真光，并遵行祂的道，使我们能改变成祂的模样，并与祂一同在荣耀里活着；祂与祢及圣灵同受敬拜，永世无尽。阿们。
Eternal God, our glorious King, whose Son Jesus Christ was seen in splendour by his chosen witnesses: give us, your servants, faith to see in him the true light and to walk in his way, that we may be transformed into his likeness and live with him in glory, where he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.

你听说过这个吗：《卧虎藏龙》——这是一部香港电影，由周润发、杨紫琼等人主演……曾获得40多个奖项，并在2001年获得10项奥斯卡提名。
Have you heard about this: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon—was a HK movie, played by Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh… which won over 40 awards and was nominated for 10 academy awards in 2001…

“卧虎藏龙”原是一个中文成语，指代未被发现的大师、隐藏的人才或各处不为人知的非凡人物。不要低估任何人——他或她可能拥有某种隐藏的力量或潜能。岩石后藏着猛虎，树根下盘着卧龙……拿破仑·波拿巴曾说：“中国是一头沉睡的狮子。让她睡吧，因为当她醒来时，她将震动世界。”
‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’ was originally a Chinese idiom referring to undiscovered masters, hidden talents, unrecognized extraordinary people in places. Don’t underestimate anyone – he or she may have some kind of hidden strength, or concealed talent. Tiger hidden behind a rock, a dragon coiled in roots… Napoleon Bonaparte once said “China is a sleeping lion. Let her sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world.”

习近平主席在2014年表示，这头沉睡的狮子已经醒了——中国是一个强大的国家，中国人聪明勤奋……他们不再是“东亚病夫”，而是正在崛起成为世界的领导者。
President Xi Jinping said in 2014 this sleeping lion has woken up—China is a strong country, Chinese are intelligent and diligent… they are not ‘sick man of Asia’ anymore, but they are rising to be leaders of the world.

然而，在讲道中我们不谈论电影，不谈论政治，也不谈论个人或国家的野心。我们谈论的是基督。今天我们谈论基督的变像，谈论耶稣灿烂的神性——祂的脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白放光。
Well, in a sermon we are not talking about movies, we are not talking about politics, we are not talking about personal or national ambitions. We are talking about Christ, today we talk about the transfiguration of Christ, we talk about the radiant divinity of Jesus – His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became dazzling white.

登山变像提醒我们，耶稣不仅是一个人，祂是神道成肉身。是的，祂有肉体的局限，会疲劳和饥饿，甚至会生气或失望。是的，祂像我们一样受过诱惑，但祂是那显明神并映射神荣耀的神之子。是的，耶稣只是一个木匠的儿子，出生时没有摇篮也没有房间，祂没有美貌或威严让我们羡慕，祂被藐视、被厌弃、受击打、苦待；祂被控告、欺压、受难，却不开口，不反抗，不为自己辩护。但祂绝不是懦夫，不是弱者，不是任人践踏的垫脚石，也不是无名小卒……
The Transfiguration reminds us that Jesus is not merely a human being, he is God became flesh, yes he has his physical limits that he could be tired and hungry, he could even be angry or disappointed. Yes he was tempted like all of us, but he is the glorified Son of God who reveals God and reflects God. Yes Jesus was just a carpenter’s son, a baby had no crib and no room, a man had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, he was despised and rejected, he was stricken and smitten, he was accused, oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth, he did not fight back, he did not stand up for himself, but certainly he was not a coward, he was not a wimp, he was not a doormat, he was not a nobody….

祂在展示谦卑，正如使徒保罗在腓立比书第2章中要求我们效法基督的谦卑：凡事不可结党，不可贪图虚浮的荣耀；只要存心谦卑，各人看别人比自己强。各人不要单顾自己的事，也要顾别人的事……
He was demonstrating humility, as the apostle Paul asks us to imitate Christ’s humility in Philippians chapter 2: Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others….

耶稣本有神的形象，不以自己与神同等为强夺的，反倒虚己，取了奴仆的形象……就自己卑微，存心顺服，以至于死，且死在十字架上！耶稣，才是真正的“卧虎藏龙”……
Jesus, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant… he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross! Jesus, truly a crouching tiger a hidden dragon…

当我们沉浸于并舍不得离开任何“山顶”体验时，登山变像教导我们，在体验神的荣耀之后，我们必须下山跟随耶稣去服侍，背起十字架，并在十字架上死。耶稣这位得荣耀的神之子，愿意承受十字架的侮辱、羞辱、耻辱和惩罚，这一切都是为了我们的益处，都是为了我们。
When we all enjoy and don’t want to let go of any "mountain top" experience, the Transfiguration teaches that after experiencing God's glory, we must descend to follow Jesus in service, in taking up our cross, and in dying on the cross. Jesus the glorified Son of God was willing to embrace the insults and the humiliation, the shame and the punishment of the cross, all for our benefits, all on our behalf.

当我们认为自己处于灵性高峰时，当我们认为自己了解关于神和圣经的一切时，我们必须回到凡人的水平，回到初学者的水平，更加脚踏实地，去包容并认同那些挣扎中、软弱和易受伤害的人。
When we think we are on the spiritual highs, when we think we know everything about God and about the Bible, we must come down to a human’s level, to a beginner’s level, to be more down to earth, to accommodate, to identify with those who struggle, who are weak and vulnerable.

耶稣是谦卑的，但耶稣也需要显露祂的本色。耶稣不是在炫耀，祂是在向我们展示祂确实是神的儿子，是荣耀且全能的神。因此，祂施行了许多神迹，以权柄教导，责备法利赛人，斥责邪灵和撒旦。因此祂变了形象，脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。在某种程度上，我们必须知道耶稣是一位大能的神，这样我们才会真正谦卑下来信靠祂并顺服祂。
Jesus is humble but Jesus needs to show his true colour. Jesus is not showing off, he is showing us he is truly the Son of God, he is truly the glorious and the almighty God, hence he performed a lot of miracles, hence he taught with authority, hence he rebuked the pharisees, he rebuked demons and satan, hence he transfigured, hence His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Somehow we must know that Jesus is a powerful God, so we would really humble ourselves to trust him and to obey him.

耶稣在彼得、雅各和约翰面前变了形象。多年后，作为亲眼目睹者之一，彼得在彼得后书1:16-18写下了这一经历。彼得写道：“我们从前将我们主耶稣基督的大能和他降临的事告诉你们，并不是随从乖巧捏造的虚言，乃是亲眼见过他的威荣。他从父神得尊贵荣耀的时候，从极大荣光之中有声音出来向他说：‘这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。’我们同他在圣山的时候，亲自听见这声音从天上出来。”
Jesus transfigured in front of Peter James and John. Years later, Peter wrote about this experience on 2 Peter 1:16-18, as one of the eye witnesses. Peter wrote, “We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when the voice came to him from the majestic glory saying, ‘This is my Son whom I love. With him I am well pleased.’ We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.”

关于变像的这段记载是耶稣神性的有力证据。道成肉身神学的核心是耶稣表现得平凡。这对我们的救赎至关重要。神通过耶稣作工，而祂必须表现得平凡，这对救赎是必不可少的。父神希望耶稣在彼得、雅各和约翰面前显出荣耀。这变像就发生在他们眼前。变像不是为了耶稣的益处，而是为了门徒和我们的益处，是为了增强我们的信心，在祂启示的光中增加我们的信心——尽管耶稣受苦受死，祂依然是神，祂是一位受苦却荣耀的神。祂受苦是为了理解我们的痛苦，祂得荣耀是为了带给我们荣耀。
This account of the Transfiguration is overwhelming evidence of Jesus’ deity. Essential to the theology of the incarnation was that Jesus appeared ordinary. That’s essential to our salvation. It’s essential to the salvation that God works through Jesus, and He had to appear ordinary. God the Father wanted Jesus to appear glorious to Peter, James, and John. This transfiguration happened right before their eyes. The transfiguration was not for Jesus’s benefit, it was for disciples and for ours, to boost up our confidence, to increase our faith in the light of his revelation, that although Jesus suffered and died, he is God and he is a suffering but glorious God, who suffers to understand our sufferings, who is glorified to bring us glories.

神的儿子成了人子，祂依然是神，并充满了神性。圣子通过圣灵彰显神的荣耀。通过同一位圣灵，父神爱祂的儿子，并向我们众人推荐祂。
The Son of God became the son of man who is still God and full of God. God the Son reveals God’s glory through God’s Spirit. Through the same Spirit, God the Father loves and commends his Son to us all.

“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的。你们要听他。”听从耶稣，这位道成肉身的话语。曾亲身生活在世上的神，知道我们需要听到什么，知道什么样的真理对我们有益。因此，要听祂，不听别人的，只听祂，唯独听祂。
“This is my Son whom I love. With him I am well pleased. Listen to him.” Listen to Jesus, the word become flesh, God who once lived physically in the world, knows what we need to hear, knows what truth would benefit us. Therefore, listen to him, listen to no others, but to him and only him.

我们祷告：
神我们的父，在祢儿子基督变像的荣耀中，祢借着证实先知的见证坚固了我们的信心，并向我们展示了祢为亲爱的儿女所预备的辉煌。当我们聆听祢儿子的声音时，求祢帮助我们与祂一同成为永生的继承人；祂与祢及圣灵同受敬拜，永世无尽。阿们。
Let us pray:
God our Father, in the transfigured glory of Christ your Son, you strengthen our faith by confirming the witness of your prophets, and show us the splendour you have prepared for your beloved sons and daughters. As we listen to the voice of your Son, help us to become heirs to eternal life with him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.
