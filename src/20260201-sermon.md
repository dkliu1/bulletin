# 弥迦书 6:1-8 (Micah 6:1-8)
# 经文部分

1 当听耶和华的话。他说：“你起来向山岭争辩，使冈陵听你的话。” Listen to what the LORD says: “Stand up, plead my case before the mountains; let the hills hear what you have to say.”

2 山岭和地永久的根基啊，要听耶和华争辩的话！因为耶和华告他的百姓，要与以色列争辩。 “Hear, you mountains, the LORD’s accusation; listen, you everlasting foundations of the earth. For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel.”

3 “我的百姓啊，我向你做了什么呢？我在什么事上使你厌烦？你可以回答我。” “My people, what have I done to you? How have I burdened you? Answer me.”

4 “我曾将你从埃及地领出来，从作奴仆之家救赎你；我也差遣摩西、亚伦和米利暗在你前面行。” “I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.”

5 “我的百姓啊，你们当追念摩押王巴勒所设的谋和比珥的儿子巴兰回答他的话，并你们从什亭到吉甲所经历的事，为要使你们知道耶和华公义的作为。” “My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered. Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.”

6 我朝见耶和华，在至高上帝面前跪拜，当献上什么呢？岂可献一岁的牛犊为燔祭吗？ With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old?

7 耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊，或是万万的油河吗？我岂可为自己的罪过献我的长子吗？为心中的罪恶献我身所生的吗？ Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

8 世人哪，耶和华已指示你何为善。他向你所要的是什么呢？只要你行公义，好怜悯，存谦卑的心，与你的上帝同行。 He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.
## 讲章解析

你曾坐在法庭里吗？你可能是律师、法官、法庭书记官、陪审团成员，或者只是对某个案件感兴趣的人。现在，请允许我邀请你关注这一桩圣经中的历史审判案。上帝既是法官也是检察官，以色列在耶和华面前受审。时间是公元前8世纪，现场有永恒不动的见证人——大山、小冈和地永久的根基。先知弥迦传唤道：站起来，听这桩重大的案件，因为耶和华告他的百姓，要与以色列争辩。上帝询问被告：“我向你做了什么呢？我在什么事上使你厌烦？你可以回答我。” Have you been sitting in a court room? You may be a lawyer or a judge, you may be a court officer, or a jury member or someone who is interested in a certain court case. May I now invite you to pay attention to this biblical and historical court case, with God being the judge and the prosecutor, with Israel on trial before the Lord, in the 8th century BC, with the presence of unshakable witnesses, which are the mountains and the hills, and the strong foundations of the earth. Prophet Micah summons: Stand up to hear this serious case, For the LORD has a case against his people; he is lodging a charge against Israel. God was asking the offenders, “What have I done to you?” How have I burdened you? Answer me.

上帝的意思是：我待你们只有恩慈，你们却以拒绝和叛逆来回报。 God meant I had done nothing but good to you but had been repaid with rejection and rebellion.

4 “我曾将你从埃及地领出来，从作奴仆之家救赎你；我也差遣摩西、亚伦和米利暗在你前面行。” “I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.”

上帝不仅没有恶待以色列，反而给了他们极大的恩惠。他救赎了他们，并赐予他们属灵的领袖。上帝对以色列的指控是有力的，以色列在先知的法庭上是有罪的。 Not only did God not do evil to Israel, He did them an enormous amount of good. He redeemed them and gave them godly leaders. God’s case against Israel was strong and Israel was guilty in the prophet’s court.

5 “我的百姓啊，你们当追念摩押王巴勒所设的谋和比珥的儿子巴兰回答他的话。” “My people, remember what Balak king of Moab plotted and what Balaam son of Beor answered.”

《民数记》22-24章讲述了巴勒和巴兰的故事。巴勒要求巴兰咒诅以色列人，巴兰反而祝福了他们。当巴兰倾听并宣讲上帝的话语时，他没有咒诅以色列，而是每一次都祝福他们。当咒诅不成时，巴兰向巴勒献计如何让以色列陷入咒诅：摩押人不是直接咒诅，而是引诱他们行淫和拜偶像，从而使上帝咒诅那不忠不义的以色列。巴勒照做了，差遣年轻女子进入以色列营地，引诱他们陷入淫乱和偶像崇拜。因着他们的罪，上帝确实惩罚了以色列——降下审判的瘟疫，导致两万四千人丧生。 Numbers 22-24 tells the story of Balak and Balaam. Balak asked Balaam to curse the Israelites, but Balaam bless the Israelites instead. When Balaam listened and spoke God’s word, he did not curse Israel – but he blessed them each time. When he did not curse Israel, Balaam answered Balak on how to bring Israel under a curse. Instead of trying to have a prophet curse them, the Moabites would lead them into fornication and idolatry, and thus God would curse idolatrous and disobedient Israel. Balak did just that, sending his young women into the camp of Israel to lead Israel into sexual immorality and idolatry. Because of their sin, God did curse Israel – He brought a plague of judgment upon Israel that killed 24,000.

鉴于此，以色列必须记住，上帝绝不会被说服去咒诅以色列，除非他们因自己的偶像崇拜和悖逆而自招咒诅。在先知的法庭上，上帝向以色列表明，如果他们感到受咒诅，那完全是他们自己的责任。 In light of this, Israel must remember that God could never be persuaded to curse Israel, except if they brought curses on themselves through their own idolatry and disobedience. In the prophet’s courtroom God showed Israel that if they felt cursed in any way, it was entirely their responsibility.

“并你们从什亭到吉甲所经历的事，为要使你们知道耶和华公义的作为。” “Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the LORD.”

在《约书亚记》3-4章中，从什亭到吉甲的旅程标志着以色列人从旷野进入应许之地的过渡，他们在什亭最后一次安营，在吉甲第一次扎营……这段旅程提醒以色列人，上帝是何等良善、何等拯救。他们应当永远感激耶和华公义的作为。 On Joshua 3-4, the journey from Shittim to Gilgal marks the Israelites’ transition from the wilderness to the promised land, their last encampment in Shittim, their first camp in Gilgal… such journey reminds the Israelites, all about God’s goodness, God’s delivery, they should be grateful always for the righteous acts of the Lord.

6 “我朝见耶和华，在至高上帝面前跪拜，当献上什么呢？” “With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God?”

那些不愿悔改的以色列人面对上帝的提醒和启示，不仅没有感恩，反而带着苦毒和愤恨提出了一个问题。在弥迦虚构的法庭中，以色列从被告席上对上帝喊道：“你到底想要我怎样？” Instead of being grateful with God’s reminder and enlightenment, the unrepentant Israelites asked a question out of bitterness and resentment. In Micah’s imagined courtroom, Israel called out to God from the offenders’ stand, and said: “Just what do You want from me?”

“耶和华岂喜悦千千的公羊，或是万万的油河吗？”我们几乎能听到以色列人在被告席上对上帝咆哮：“上帝，你要求太多了。没有什么能让你满足。即便我们献上千千的公羊、万万的油河，甚至牺牲自己的长子，也不足以取悦你。你太不可理喻了。” Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, ten thousand rivers of oil? We can almost hear Israel shouting at God from the offenders’ stand. “You ask too much, God. Nothing will satisfy You. If we brought thousands of rams or rivers of oil or even to sacrifice our own firstborn it would not be enough to please You. You are unreasonable.”

难怪先知弥迦必须如此严肃地对这群以色列人说话。他们对那位立约的供应者——上帝表现得冒犯、防御、无礼且忘恩负义。作为生活在上帝领地上的子民，他们的社会充满了严重的腐败，富人频繁剥削穷人。就像当今世界发生的一样：富人越富，穷人越穷，因为富人在剥削穷人，而不愿与他们分享。 No wonder Prophet Micah has to speak so seriously with this group of Israelites, they are being offensive, defensive, rude and ungrateful to God their covenant provider. As God’s people living in God’s regions, their society is marked with intense corruption and frequent exploitation of the poor by the rich. Like what’s happening nowadays, the rich is getting richer, and the poor is getting poorer, as the rich is ripping off the poor, and not sharing with the poor.

上帝并非不可理喻，他也从未要求太多。想想上帝是多么慈悲，但作为他的子民，我们却可能表现得刻薄、贪婪、不公、虚伪。礼仪性的守节和礼拜是好的，非常好。圣灰星期三和预苦期（大斋期）是指定让我们反思罪恶、承认软弱和盲点的时刻。在预苦期学习中学习圣经真理，今年我们的主题是“喜乐”……作为圣公会、作为一个传统教会，我们拥有所有季节性的仪式，但我们不是机械地将其作为例行公事，也不是作为宗教义务，我们这样做是因为我们感激这位仁慈的上帝，他因怜悯和爱向我们指明了正确的生活方式。 God is not unreasonable, and he is never asking too much. Just think about how gracious God is, but as his people, we may be mean, greedy, unfair, hypocritical. Ceremonial observances and liturgical worship is good, very good, Ash Wed, Lent is the time designated for us to reflect on our sins, to confess our weakness and to admit our blind spots, learn the Bible of truth in Lenten Study, the theme of Joy for this year… as a Anglican church, as a traditional church, we have all seasonal ritual, but we don’t do it mechanically as a routine, we don’t do it as a religious duty, we do it as we are thankful to the merciful God who is merciful and loving enough to show us the right way of life.

## 正确的生活方式，即天国的价值观，是清晰且直接的： The right way of life, the kingdom lifestyle is clear and direct:

第一，行公义（Do justly）： “以公正、公平的方式对待他人。你愿意人怎样待你，你也要怎样待人。” Firstly, Do justly: “Act in a just, fair way towards others. Treat them as you would want to be treated.”

第二，好怜悯（Love mercy）： “不仅要施怜悯，更要热爱怜悯。因为我们热爱这位怜悯的上帝，所以热爱这样做。以我们从上帝那里得到的同样分量的怜悯去对待他人。” Secondly, Love mercy: “Don’t just show mercy, but love mercy, love to do it as we love the merciful God. Give others the same measure of mercy we have received from God.”

第三，存谦卑的心与上帝同行（Walk humbly with your God）： 如果我们真正承认上帝是伟大的，而我们是渺小的；上帝是主权者，他始终知道自己在做什么，而我们却常常犹豫不决，甚至不了解自己是谁、想要什么……上帝是全然圣洁的，而我们是全然罪恶的……《诗篇》14:1和53:1说：“愚顽人心里说：‘没有上帝’。”如果我们认为可以离开上帝独行，如果我们认为可以与上帝争辩、反对上帝，我们就是傲慢的愚顽人。 Thirdly, Walk humbly with your God: If we truly admit God is so big and we are so small, God is sovereign and He always knows what He is doing, but somehow we are wishy washy, we don’t even understand who we are and what we want… God is perfectly holy but we are perfectly sinful… Psalm 14:1 53:1 The fool says in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ We will be a arrogant fool, if we think we can walk alone without God, if we think we can argue with God, object God or against God.

《撒母耳记上》15:22中先知撒母耳明确表示：“听命胜于献祭；顺从胜于公羊的脂油。” 1 Samuel 15:22 Prophet Samuel made this clear: To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.

上帝喜爱我们的顺服。上帝察看我们的内心，而不是外在的表现和仪表。上帝不需要我们的金钱，甚至不需要我们的时间和才干……但他需要我们信靠与顺服，去察验并遵行他的旨意。当然，上帝喜欢我们多奉献，但要是甘心乐意的，而不是出于规条或强求。 God delights in our obedience to him, God sees into our inner heart but not our outer performance and appearance. God doesn’t need our money, even our time and talents… but he needs us to trust and obey, to discern and to act upon His will. Of course God likes us to give more, but accordingly and cheerfully, not by rules nor by force.

## 后。6 我朝见耶和华，在至高上帝面前跪拜，当献上什么呢？ Ultimately. 6 With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God?

新约告诉我们，我们来到上帝面前是靠着基督的宝血，靠着耶稣的救恩，靠着圣灵的工作。带着我们谦卑的罪孽认信，我们都被宣判无罪，都被释放了……由于耶稣承担了我们的罪孽和软弱，我们被宣告“无罪”，通过对他信靠，我们被称义了。 The New Testament says we come before the God with the blood of Christ, with Jesus’ Salvation, with the work of the Holy Spirit, with our humble confession of sins, we are all acquitted, we are all set free… we are all declared ‘Not guilty’ as Jesus has bore our sins and infirmities, through faith in Him, we are declared righteous.

因着耶稣，我们来到上帝面前，他不再是我们的法官，而是我们的天父。上帝通过他的儿子耶稣基督得着尊崇和荣耀，耶稣自甘卑微，顺服至死，且死在十字架上…… With Jesus we come to God who is no longer our judge but our heavenly Father. God is exalted and honored through his son Jesus Christ, who has humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross…

## 最后，我想说：感谢耶稣，因为你就是道路、真理、生命。阿们。 To conclude, I would say: Thank you Jesus, as you are the Way, the Truth and the Life. Amen.
