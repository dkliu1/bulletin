经文 Scripture Reading

出埃及记 Exodus 32:7–14

和合本（简体）
7 耶和华吩咐摩西说：“下去吧！因为你的百姓，就是你从埃及地领出来的，已经败坏了。
8 他们快快地偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸了一只牛犊，向它下拜，献祭，说：‘以色列啊，这就是领你出埃及地的神。’
9 耶和华对摩西说：“我看这百姓真是硬着颈项的百姓。
10 你且由着我，我要向他们发烈怒，将他们灭绝，使你的后裔成为大国。”
11 摩西便恳求耶和华他的神说：“耶和华啊，你为什么向你的百姓发烈怒呢？这百姓是你用大能和大力的手从埃及地领出来的。
12 为什么使埃及人议论说：‘他领他们出去是要降祸与他们，把他们杀在山中，将他们从地上除灭。’求你转意，不发你的烈怒，后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。
13 求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕、以撒、以色列，你曾指着自己起誓说：‘我必使你们的后裔多如天上的星，且我要将所应许的这全地赐给你们的后裔，他们要永远承受为业。’”
14 于是耶和华后悔，不把所说的祸降与他的百姓。

NIV
7 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.
8 They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’
9 “I have seen these people,” the LORD said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people.
10 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
11 But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. “LORD,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.
13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’”
14 Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.

个人见证 My Testimony

我不是生来就是圣公会信徒，甚至不是生来就是基督徒。
I was not born as an Anglican, no, I was not even born as a Christian.

我是在香港读书时信主的，那时我在一间佛教学校读书，但却有一群热心的基督徒同学向我分享福音。
I became a Christian in Hong Kong, when I studied in a Buddhist school many years ago, with a group of keen Christian classmates who shared with me the good news of Christ.

起初我去了一些传统的教会，但并不喜欢，后来我在宣道会自由堂（Evangelical Free Church）里稳定聚会大约六年，直到我与 Rick 结婚并移民到澳洲墨尔本。
I first attended a traditional church, which I didn’t really like, then I remained instead in an Evangelical Free Church for about six years, until I married Rick and migrated to Melbourne, Australia.

Rick 毕业于药剂学院后，进入了圣公会的 Ridley College 修读神学，并成为圣公会牧者。自然地，我也成为了圣公会信徒。
After Rick graduated in the pharmacy college in Parkville, he moved next door to study at Ridley College, an Anglican theological seminary. He then became an Anglican clergy, so naturally I became an Anglican too.

多年下来，我逐渐建立起对圣公会崇拜与事奉的兴趣、欣赏、偏爱与投入。
Over the years, I have developed my interests, appreciation, preference, and dedication in worshipping and serving God in the Anglican Church.

摩西的代祷 Moses’ Intercession

摩西是旧约中一个典型的代祷者。他多次为悖逆的以色列人向圣洁的神恳求。
Moses was a typical example as an intercessor in the Old Testament. He prayed to the holy God on behalf of the rebellious Israelites.

在《出埃及记》、《利未记》、《民数记》和《申命记》中，我们多次读到摩西为以色列人求赦免。
On the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, we hear and we read how Moses on many occasions pleaded with God to forgive the Israelites.

摩西并没有因“升迁”的机会动心，而是为百姓求情，强调神的慈爱与赦免，提醒神的应许和名声。
Moses was not tempted by this offer of promotion; instead of seeking benefit for himself, he pleaded on behalf of the people, affirming God’s love and forgiveness, reminding Him of His promises and His name.

他甚至说：
He even said:

出埃及记 32:31-32 (和合本)
“唉，这百姓大大得罪了，自己作了金像。倘或你肯赦免他们的罪……不然，求你从你所写的册上涂抹我的名。”

Exodus 32:31-32 (NIV)
“‘Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.’”

这几乎不仅是代祷，而是愿意替代百姓受刑罚。
This sounds more than intercession, but substitution.

基督的代祷 Christ’s Intercession

摩西和保罗虽愿意为罪人牺牲，却仍是有限的人。耶稣基督是完美的神子，祂不仅代求，更亲自担当世人的罪，成为完全的赎罪祭。
Though Moses and Paul were willing to sacrifice for sinners, they were fallible humans. Jesus Christ, the perfect Son of God, not only intercedes but also bore the sins of humanity as the sufficient atonement.

希伯来书 7:25 (和合本)
“凡靠着他进到神面前的人，他都能拯救到底；因为他是长远活着，替他们祈求。”

Hebrews 7:25 (NIV)
“Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.”

耶稣的代求是永恒的，祂体恤我们的软弱与挣扎，用祂的祷告扶持和坚固我们。
The intercession of Jesus is eternal; He understands our weaknesses and struggles, upholding and strengthening us through His prayers.

罗马书 8:34 (和合本)
“有基督耶稣已经死了，而且从死里复活，现今在神的右边，也替我们祈求。”

Romans 8:34 (NIV)
“Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.”

耶稣是我们的中保 Jesus Our Advocate

约翰一书 2:1 (和合本)
“若有人犯罪，在父那里我们有一位中保，就是那义者耶稣基督。”

1 John 2:1 (NIV)
“If anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.”

这里的“中保”就像辩护律师，强调耶稣在神面前为信徒申辩。
An “advocate” here is like a defense lawyer, emphasizing Jesus’ role in pleading the case of believers before God.

耶稣用祂的义和祂完成的赎罪来回应撒但的一切控告。
Jesus presents His righteousness and atoning work as the answer to every accusation of Satan.

因此圣经鼓励我们：
Therefore, Scripture encourages us:

希伯来书 4:16 (和合本)
“所以，我们只管坦然无惧地来到施恩的宝座前，为要得怜恤，蒙恩惠，作随时的帮助。”

Hebrews 4:16 (NIV)
“Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”

结语 Conclusion

今天，我在这里要感谢耶稣，也要感谢所有的代祷者，特别是圣大卫堂的弟兄姊妹，你们为世界、为教会、为失丧的人、为各样患病与困境中的人祷告。
Finally, I stand here to thank Jesus and all the intercessors, especially those at St David’s, who pray and intercede for the world, the Church, the lost, and those in sickness and troubles.

阿们。
Amen.
