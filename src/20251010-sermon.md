# Jeremiah 29:1–7 / 耶利米书 29:1–7

1 This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
1 先知耶利米从耶路撒冷寄信与被掳的祭司、先知、和众民，就是尼布甲尼撒从耶路撒冷掳到巴比伦去的长老。

2 (This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.)
2 （这在耶哥尼雅王和太后、太监、犹大、耶路撒冷的首领，并工匠铁匠都离开耶路撒冷以后。）

3 He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:
3 他借沙番的儿子以利亚撒和希勒家的儿子基玛利手中寄去，这二人是犹大王西底家打发往巴比伦去见巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒的。

4 This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
4 万军之耶和华以色列的神对一切被我从耶路撒冷掳到巴比伦去的人如此说：

5 “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.
5 你们要盖造房屋，住在其中；栽种田园，吃其中所产的果子。

6 Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease.
6 娶妻生儿女，为你们的儿子娶妻，使你们的女儿嫁人，生儿养女；在那里生养众多，不至减少。

7 Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.”
7 我所使你们被掳到的那城，你们要为那城求平安，为那城祈求耶和华，因为那城得平安，你们也随着得平安。

## Explanation and Reflection / 经文释义与反思

Prophet Jeremiah was sending a letter from Jerusalem to the Jewish exiles who had been taken to Babylon by the Babylonians after being defeated.
先知耶利米从耶路撒冷寄信给那些被巴比伦人掳去的以色列人。这是上帝的呼召，要这些被掳的人在异乡忠心生活、安然忍耐。

The Babylonians probably settled them in a region near the River Chebar that had been devastated by war. Their job was to redevelop that wasted land.
巴比伦人可能把他们安置在革巴河一带，那片地区曾被战争摧毁。被掳的以色列人被派去重新耕种那荒废之地。

Psalm 137:1 says: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.”
诗篇 137:1 说：“我们曾在巴比伦的河边坐下，一追想锡安就哭了。”
这表达了以色列人在被掳期间的悲伤与思念。后来，这节经文更被谱成著名的歌曲《By the Rivers of Babylon》。

The captive Israelites became strangers and refugees in a pagan land. Yet the treatment they received was complex — from hardship to a relatively stable life.
被掳的以色列人成了异乡的寄居者、战俘与难民。然而他们的处境并非一概悲惨，从最初的痛苦到后来逐渐适应，甚至有部分人生活还算安稳。

In exile, they maintained their faith — studying the Torah, keeping the Sabbath, circumcision, and worshiping God even without the Temple.
在被掳之地，他们仍坚守信仰——研读律法、守安息日、行割礼，即使没有圣殿，也在各处聚集敬拜上帝。

Jeremiah assured them of God’s promise: after seventy years, God would bring them back.
耶利米提醒他们，上帝应许七十年后要带他们归回故土。
他驳斥了假先知的虚言——那时日不会短暂，而是要经历漫长的七十年。

Therefore, Jeremiah urged: build houses, plant gardens, marry, raise families, live peacefully, and seek the welfare of the city.
因此，耶利米呼吁他们：盖房、种园、结婚、生子、安居乐业，并要为所在的城求平安。
若那城得平安，他们也必平安。

## Jeremiah 29:11 later affirms this promise:
“‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.’”
耶利米书 29:11 说：“耶和华说：我知道我向你们所怀的意念，是赐平安的意念，不是降灾祸的意念，要叫你们末后有指望。”

This teaches us that God’s discipline is never without purpose. The seventy years of exile symbolize a time of refining and waiting under God’s sovereignty.
这教导我们，上帝的管教并非无意义。被掳的七十年，是一个在上帝主权下被炼净、被预备的时期。

Just as Abraham lived as a stranger in tents, waiting for the city built by God (Hebrews 11:9–10), we too live as pilgrims on earth.
正如亚伯拉罕“因信在应许之地作客，好像在异地居住帐棚”（希伯来书 11:9–10），我们在世上也是寄居的客旅。

We await a better country — a heavenly one. “Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.” (Hebrews 11:16)
我们等候那更美的家乡——天上的城。“所以神被称为他们的神，并不以为耻，因为他已经给他们预备了一座城。”（希伯来书 11:16）

On that glorious day, all sorrow will end, and we shall see “The Holy City, the New Jerusalem.”
在那荣耀的日子，一切悲伤都将止息，我们将看见“圣城，新耶路撒冷”。

## As the song The Holy City beautifully declares:
“I saw the Holy City beside the tideless sea; … It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away.
‘Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Sing, for the night is o’er! Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna for evermore!’”
正如那首《圣城》的歌词所唱：
“我看见圣城在海边闪光；神的荣光照亮街道，大门常开，凡愿意的都可进入。……‘耶路撒冷！耶路撒冷！高唱和散那！夜已过去，永远赞美主！’”
——阿们。
