# 哥林多前书 1:1–9  
1 Corinthians 1:1–9

保罗，奉　神旨意，蒙召作耶稣基督使徒的，并兄弟所提尼，  
Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,

写信给在哥林多　神的教会，就是在基督耶稣里成圣、蒙召作圣徒的，以及所有在各处求告我主耶稣基督之名的人；基督是他们的主，也是我们的主。  
To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:

愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父并主耶稣基督归与你们。  
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

我常为你们感谢我的　神，因　神在基督耶稣里所赐给你们的恩惠；  
I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.

又因你们在他里面凡事富足，口才、知识都全备，  
For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—

正如我为基督作的见证，在你们心里得以坚固，  
God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.

以致你们在恩赐上没有一样不及人的，等候我们的主耶稣基督显现。  
Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.

他也必坚固你们到底，叫你们在我主耶稣基督的日子无可责备。  
He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

　神是信实的，你们原是被他所召，好与他儿子——我们的主耶稣基督一同得分。  
God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

“愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父并主耶稣基督归与你们。”  
这是保罗赐给哥林多教会多么全面、丰富的问安与祝福。  
“Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”  
What a comprehensive greeting and blessing Paul was giving the church in Corinth.

“恩典永远在前，平安永远在后。因为恩典是平安的源头；没有恩典，就没有平安；一旦有了恩典，平安必然随之而来。”  
“Grace is always first, peace always second. This is due to the fact that grace is the source of peace. Without grace there is no peace, but when grace is given, peace must follow.”

当我们做错事、伤害他人、造成损失时，我们最需要的就是恩典。  
我们本该被追责、被定罪，但因着恩典，我们得赦免，良心得释放。  
当恩典和有恩典的人进入我们的生命时，我们心里何等轻省。  
Grace—we need it most when we do something wrong, when we offend someone and cause damage and hurt. We are held responsible and guilty, but by grace we are forgiven, freed from the burden of guilt, and deeply relieved when grace and gracious people enter our lives.

平安，取代争执、冲突和对立；  
平安意味着安宁、平静、安歇、无忧无虑、无惧无疚。  
人与人之间若有和平的关系，是何等的美好——  
而这一切，都是因着恩典。  
Peace, instead of disputes, conflicts, and confrontations. Peace brings tranquility, calmness, rest, freedom from trouble, anxiety, and guilt. How enjoyable it is when we have peaceful relationships with one another—because of grace.

恩典与平安，应当成为每一位基督徒的标记。  
Grace and peace should be the signatures of all Christians.

基督徒在耶稣基督里成圣，罪被基督的宝血遮盖，  
因着基督的死，罪疚被神的赦免除去，  
如今蒙召成为　神的圣民，  
与污秽的世界分
