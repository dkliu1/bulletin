我常为你们感谢我的　神，因　神在基督耶稣里所赐给你们的恩惠；  
I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.

又因你们在他里面凡事富足，口才、知识都全备，  
For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—

正如我为基督作的见证，在你们心里得以坚固，  
God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.

以致你们在恩赐上没有一样不及人的，等候我们的主耶稣基督显现。  
Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.

他也必坚固你们到底，叫你们在我主耶稣基督的日子无可责备。  
He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

　神是信实的，你们原是被他所召，好与他儿子——我们的主耶稣基督一同得分。  
God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

“愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父并主耶稣基督归与你们。”  
这是保罗赐给哥林多教会多么全面、丰富的问安与祝福。  
“Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”  
What a comprehensive greeting and blessing Paul was giving the church in Corinth.

“恩典永远在前，平安永远在后。因为恩典是平安的源头；没有恩典，就没有平安；一旦有了恩典，平安必然随之而来。”  
“Grace is always first, peace always second. This is due to the fact that grace is the source of peace. Without grace there is no peace, but when grace is given, peace must follow.”

当我们做错事、伤害他人、造成损失时，我们最需要的就是恩典。  
我们本该被追责、被定罪，但因着恩典，我们得赦免，良心得释放。  
当恩典和有恩典的人进入我们的生命时，我们心里何等轻省。  
Grace—we need it most when we do something wrong, when we offend someone and cause damage and hurt. We are held responsible and guilty, but by grace we are forgiven, freed from the burden of guilt, and deeply relieved when grace and gracious people enter our lives.

平安，取代争执、冲突和对立；  
平安意味着安宁、平静、安歇、无忧无虑、无惧无疚。  
人与人之间若有和平的关系，是何等的美好——  
而这一切，都是因着恩典。  
Peace, instead of disputes, conflicts, and confrontations. Peace brings tranquility, calmness, rest, freedom from trouble, anxiety, and guilt. How enjoyable it is when we have peaceful relationships with one another—because of grace.

恩典与平安，应当成为每一位基督徒的标记。  
Grace and peace should be the signatures of all Christians.

基督徒在耶稣基督里成圣，罪被基督的宝血遮盖，  
因着基督的死，罪疚被神的赦免除去，  
如今蒙召成为　神的圣民，  
与污秽的世界分别出来，与抵挡、否认基督的人有别。  
Christians are sanctified in Jesus Christ, sins covered by the blood of Christ, guilt removed through God’s forgiveness in Christ’s death, now called to be God’s holy people, set apart from a filthy world and distinguished from those who oppose Christ.

保罗写信给“在哥林多　神的教会”。  
请注意这里的强烈对比：  
　神的教会，是一个能找到恩典与平安的地方；  
哥林多，却是一个缺乏神平安的城市，  
因为那里的人不接受、不承认救赎主耶稣基督所带来的恩典。  
Paul addressed “to the church of God which is at Corinth.” Notice the contrast: the church of God is where grace and peace are found, while Corinth lacked God’s peace because people did not accept God’s grace through Jesus Christ. Understanding this tension between church and city is crucial to understanding 1 Corinthians.

哥林多是古代世界的重要城市之一，  
富庶、繁忙、不断发展，  
也因纵情享乐而臭名昭著。  
Corinth was one of the great cities of the ancient world—prosperous, busy, growing, and infamous for reckless pleasure-seeking.

这里民族复杂，是体育、政治、军事和商业的中心。  
The city had a rich ethnic mix and was a center for sports, government, military, and business.

哥林多人敬拜许多异教神明，其中最受欢迎的是爱神阿佛洛狄忒，  
她的庙宇中据说有一千名娼妓和女祭司。  
可以想见当时社会的淫乱、道德的败坏，以及日常纵酒狂欢的生活方式。  
The Corinthians worshiped many pagan gods, including Aphrodite, who reportedly had a thousand female prostitutes and priestesses. The society was marked by moral chaos, sexual looseness, excessive drinking, and constant partying.

神学家戈登·费依总结说：  
“保罗时代的哥林多，同时像古代的纽约、洛杉矶和拉斯维加斯。”  
Gordon Fee wrote: “All of this evidence together suggests that Paul’s Corinth was at once the New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas of the ancient world.”

我在瑞德利学院读神学时的院长，莫里斯博士形容哥林多：  
“思想敏锐、物质富足，却道德败坏。”  
Dr. Leon Morris described Corinth as “Intellectually alert, materially prosperous, but morally corrupt.”

---

保罗非常熟悉哥林多这座城市。  
他在那里建立了教会，并在雅典事工之后，又回到哥林多住了十八个月（徒18章）。  
Paul knew Corinth well. He established the church there and later stayed another eighteen months after his ministry in Athens (Acts 18).

保罗大概在以弗所写信给哥林多人，  
因他从革来氏家里的人得知哥林多教会的纷争（林前1:11），  
许多问题明显源自这座败坏的城市，  
而教会似乎还不够刚强，抵挡世俗的影响、思想与价值观。  
Paul likely wrote from Ephesus after receiving reports from Chloe’s household about disturbances in Corinth. Many church issues reflected the corrupt city, and the church was not strong enough to resist worldly influence.

---

“使徒”一词源自希腊文 *apostolos*，意思是“被差遣的特使”。  
保罗是耶稣基督差遣给世界和教会的特别使者。  
“Apostle” comes from the Greek *apostolos*, meaning “special ambassador.” Paul was a special ambassador of Jesus Christ to the world and the church.

但保罗也提醒：所有基督徒都是基督的使者。  
“所以，我们作基督的使者，就好像　神藉我们劝你们一般。”（林后5:20）  
Paul reminds us that all Christians are ambassadors: “We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.”

在这个有罪的世界中，基督徒不是指责、定罪人的罪，  
而是把罪人指向耶稣，得着神的赦免。  
In a sinful world, Christians are not to judge or condemn, but to point sinners to Jesus for God’s forgiveness.

神喜爱赦免，不喜爱定罪。  
作为他的使者，我们带来的是和平与和好，而不是论断与指控。  
我们的神是施恩的神，耶稣是和平之君。  
God prefers to forgive, not to condemn. As his ambassadors, we bring peace and reconciliation, not judgment. Our God is a God of grace, and Jesus is the Prince of Peace.

耶稣说：“使人和睦的人有福了！因为他们必称为　神的儿子。”  
让我们省察自己：  
我们是真正的和平使者，还是在不知不觉中成了制造麻烦的人？  
Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.” Ask yourself honestly: are we peacemakers, or do we sometimes become troublemakers without realizing it?

---

在基督耶稣里成圣的人，被称为圣徒。  
成圣，意味着被分别出来，归于　神。  
Those sanctified in Christ Jesus are called saints—set apart from the world and unto God.

我认为，从各方面来看，圣大卫堂的弟兄姐妹在作基督使者、作圣徒的事上做得非常好，  
你们专心用神的方式做神的工。  
By all standards, the people at St David’s are doing very well as ambassadors and saints, focusing on God’s work in God’s way.

那为什么哥林多教会的人仍被称为圣徒，  
即使他们在道德、婚姻、人际、管理等方面问题重重？  
Why were the Corinthians still called saints despite many moral, marital, relational, and leadership problems?

因为我们都是靠恩典得救，  
因基督的挽回祭被称为义。  
挽回祭，指的是耶稣在十字架上担当我们的罪，转去神公义的忿怒。  
Because we are saved by grace and declared righteous through Christ’s propitiation—his sacrifice turning away God’s righteous wrath.

这是恩典的提升、恩典的改变、恩典的成圣，  
往往经历长期的跌倒与失败。  
所以，当我们看到基督徒或领袖尚未达到神的标准，  
甚至未达到“我们的标准”时，  
不必惊讶，也不必急于论断。  
This is elevation by grace, transformation by grace, sanctification by grace—often through many failures. We should not be surprised or quick to criticize.

---

保罗虽然清楚哥林多人并不完美，  
却仍为神在他们中间的工作真诚感恩。  
Though far from perfect, Paul was sincerely thankful for God’s work among the Corinthians.

他们的失败中，有神的恩典；  
他们的挣扎中，有神的平安。  
In their failures, there was grace; in their struggles, there was peace.

他们一切美善，都是因耶稣基督所赐的恩典。  
恩典，就是神按他自己的心意白白赐下。  
Everything good they had came by grace—God’s free and generous gift.

一个教会可以在物质上贫乏，  
却在圣洁的言语和对神深刻的认识上富足。  
A church may be materially poor, yet rich in holy speech and deep knowledge of God.

一个富足的教会，只宣讲神的恩典，  
不需要公开羞辱任何人的罪；  
因为“爱能遮掩许多的罪。”（彼前4:8）  
A rich church speaks of God’s grace and does not publicly shame sins, for “love covers a multitude of sins.”

我们虽仍软弱、不完全，  
却在神眼中极其宝贵、被珍爱。  
Though imperfect, we are highly valued and cherished.

保罗宣告：  
“他也必坚固你们到底，使你们在我主耶稣基督的日子无可责备。”  
不是因为我们良善，  
而是因为　神信实良善，  
他恩慈地呼召我们，与他的儿子——主耶稣基督相交。  
Paul declares that God will keep us firm to the end—not because we are good, but because God is faithful and has graciously called us into fellowship with his Son.

听了这一切，我们还能说什么呢？  
唯有说：  
谢谢主！谢谢耶稣！  
感谢、赞美我们的天父！  
阿们！阿们！哈利路亚！  
Hearing all this, what can we say but: Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Jesus! Thanks and praise to our heavenly Father. Amen! Amen! Hallelujah!
