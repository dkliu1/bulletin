路加福音 18:1–14

Luke 18:1–14

1 耶稣设一个比喻，是要人常常祷告，不可灰心。
Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.

2 他说：「某城里有一个官，不惧怕神，也不尊重世人。
He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.

3 那城里有个寡妇，常到他那里，说：‘我有一个对头，求你给我伸冤。’
And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’

4 他多日不准。后来心里说：‘我虽不惧怕神，也不尊重世人，
For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think,

5 只因这寡妇烦扰我，我就给她伸冤吧！免得她常来缠磨我。’」
Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!”

6 主说：「你们听这不义之官所说的话。
And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.

7 神的选民昼夜呼吁他，纵然为他们忍了多时，岂不终久给他们伸冤吗？
And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?

8 我告诉你们：要快快地给他们伸冤了！然而，人子来的时候，遇得见世上有信德吗？」
I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”

9 耶稣向那仗着自己是义人，藐视别人的，设一个比喻，
To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:

10 说：「有两个人上殿里去祷告，一个是法利赛人，一个是税吏。
“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

11 法利赛人站着，自言自语地祷告说：‘神啊，我感谢你，我不像别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不像这个税吏。
The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.

12 我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的，都捐上十分之一。’
I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’

13 那税吏远远地站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：‘神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！’
But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’

14 我告诉你们，这人回家去比那人倒算为义了。因为凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。」
I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

Reflection

今天我们一同庆祝 Sofia 和 Archie 的洗礼。
Today we come to celebrate the baptisms of Sofia and Archie.

我要祝贺他们的父母 Elya 和 Marisha，以及教父母 Haley、Anique 和 Gaetano（Valerie、Michelle、Paul），
I congratulate their parents Elya and Marisha, and godparents Haley, Anique, and Gaetano (Valerie, Michelle, Paul),

因为他们凭着自己在基督里的信心，把孩子带到主面前，
for bringing these children forward for baptism because of their own faith in Christ,

并且相信这信仰是如此宝贵、重要，值得从小就传递给下一代。
believing that this faith and blessing should be passed on to the little ones as early as possible.

作为成年人，我们教育和鼓励孩子尽力而为。
As adults, we educate and inspire our kids to do their best.

心理学家与教育学家都建议：要养成给孩子读故事书的习惯。
Psychologists and educators recommend reading storybooks to children as a habit.

故事能增强语言与记忆能力，促进情感与社交发展。
Stories boost language, memory, and foster emotional and social development.

圣经中也充满了故事——主日学老师用这些故事教导孩子认识神，
The Bible, too, is full of stories—Sunday School teachers use them to teach about God,

父母、祖父母与教父母也应当如此，让孩子明白神的爱。
and parents, grandparents, and godparents should do the same to help children understand God’s love.

耶稣自己也常用比喻来教导门徒真理。
Jesus himself often taught his disciples using parables.

比喻是带有道德与属灵意义的故事，揭示天国的价值与标准，
Parables are stories that illustrate moral and spiritual truths, revealing kingdom values and standards,

激励我们知道该如何行。
inspiring us to know what to do and how to do it.

今天的故事是关于祷告——为公义的祷告、为怜悯的祷告。
Today’s story is about prayer—prayers for justice, prayers for compassion.

要持续地祷告，也要带着信心祷告。
We should pray consistently and confidently.

故事中的官并非出于敬畏神或公义的心，而是因为怕麻烦，
The judge acted not because he cared about God’s justice, but to stop the widow from bothering him.

他因自己的利益行了公义。
He acted out of self-interest.

耶稣要我们明白：
Jesus’ point is this:

若连不义的官尚且如此，
If even an unjust judge responds,

那位真正公义、慈爱的神岂不更愿意垂听祂子民的呼求吗？
how much more will our righteous and loving God respond to those who cry to Him day and night?

因此，我们不可轻看任何人。
Therefore, we must not look down on anyone.

不要因年长、宗教身份或善行就自以为义。
Do not think ourselves better because of age, religion, or deeds.

若我们的动机不是出于爱神，而是出于自私或虚荣，
If our motive is not love for God but self-interest or pride,

我们就与那法利赛人无异。
then we are like the Pharisee in the story.

13节：
“那税吏远远地站着，连举目望天也不敢，只捶着胸说：‘神啊，开恩可怜我这个罪人！’”
Verse 13:
“But the tax collector stood at a distance, would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’”

14节：
“凡自高的，必降为卑；自卑的，必升为高。”
Verse 14:
“For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

让我们学习税吏那样谦卑地祷告。
We should pray humbly like the tax collector.

承认我们是罪人，承认我们都亏缺了神的荣耀。
Confess that we are sinners who fall short of God’s glory.

像孩子一样单纯地信靠神。
Believe like a little child.

受洗是信仰旅程的起点，是邀请神作我们的引导与同伴。
Baptism marks the beginning of a faith journey, asking God to be our guide and companion.

父母、祖父母、教父母，以及所有养育孩子的信徒，
Parents, grandparents, godparents, and all who nurture children,

你们会给孩子读什么故事？
what stories will you read to them?

愿你们选择那些属灵、有意义、合乎圣经真理的故事，
May you choose stories that are spiritual, meaningful, and biblically sound,

帮助他们认识造物的主，
to help them know the Creator,

明白神的性情，
understand His character,

并体会祂差遣耶稣来拯救我们的计划。
and grasp His plan of salvation through Jesus Christ.

请教导孩子：我们不必追求完美，
Teach them: we do not need to make ourselves perfect,

只需信靠并尊崇那位完美的神。
we only need to trust and honor our Perfect God.

奉圣父、圣子、圣灵的名，阿们。
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
