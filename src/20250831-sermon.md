**希伯来书 13:1-8, 15-16（和合本）**

¹你们务要常存弟兄相爱的心。²不可忘记用爱心接待客旅，因为曾有接待客旅的，不知不觉就接待了天使。³你们要记念被捆绑的人，好像与他们同受捆绑；也要记念遭苦害的人，想到自己也在肉身之内。⁴婚姻，人人都当尊重，床也不可污秽，因为苟合行淫的人，神必要审判。⁵你们存心不可贪爱钱财，要以自己所有的为足。因为主曾说："我总不撇下你，也不丢弃你。"⁶所以我们可以放胆说："主是帮助我的，我必不惧怕；人能把我怎么样呢？"⁷从前引导你们、传神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。⁸耶稣基督昨日、今日、一直到永远，是一样的。¹⁵我们应当靠着耶稣，常常以颂赞为祭献给神，这就是那承认主名之人嘴唇的果子。¹⁶只是不可忘记行善和捐输的事，因为这样的祭是神所喜悦的。

**Hebrews 13:1-8, 15-16 (NIV)**

¹Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. ²Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. ³Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. ⁴Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. ⁵Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you." ⁶So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?" ⁷Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. ⁸Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. ¹⁵Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. ¹⁶And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

希伯来书第13章是希伯来书的结尾章节。这是在前面章节呈现了一系列基督徒生活的实际教导以及大量神学真理之后的总结。整个第13章，或者说整本希伯来书，可以分为三个主要类别：个人品行、社群责任，以及基督的至高地位。

Hebrews 13 is the concluding chapter of the Book of Hebrews. It is the end after a series of practical instructions for Christian living, as well as a whole lot of theological truths presented in the preceding chapters. The whole chapter 13, or the whole Book of Hebrews can be grouped into three main categories: personal conduct, community responsibilities, and the supremacy of Christ.

这一章从开始便呼吁信徒們之弟兄之爱相待。第1-2节：「你们务要常存弟兄相爱的心。不可忘记用爱心接待客旅，因为曾有接待客旅的，不知不觉就接待了天使。」款待客人、煮汤、提供咖啡和茶，欢迎那些走进圣大卫堂的人。我们款待自己的教友，也款待陌生人，这就是我们经营二手店、咖啡厅的原因。我们服事，如同耶稣服事。我们爱，如同耶稣爱。我们欢迎，如同耶稣张开双臂拥抱和欢迎，不持偏见，不歧视，不拒绝，不排斥。

The chapter begins with a call to brotherly love among believers. v. 1-2: Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. Be hospitable. Make soup, offer coffee and tea, welcome those who walk into St David's, we practise hospitality for our own parishioners, we also practise hospitality for the strangers, that is why we operate the thrift shop, that is why we manage our café. We serve, as Jesus served. We love, as Jesus loves. We welcome, as Jesus opens his arms to embrace and to welcome, with no bias, no discrimination, no rejection, no refuse entry.

实践款待要到这样的程度，就是我们对受苦的人、贫穷的人、失业的人、无家可归的人、残疾的人能表达共情。第3节：「你们要记念被捆绑的人，好像与他们同受捆绑；也要记念遭苦害的人，想到自己也在肉身之内。」让我们总是关心那些受虐待的人，那些妇女和男人，那些青年和少年... 当他们因为家庭暴力而被虐待和攻击时，他们别无选择，只能逃离自己不安全的家，他们来不及收拾任何东西，因为他们处于危险之中。

Practise hospitality to the point, that we express empathy for the suffering, the poor, the unemployed, the homeless, the disabled. v. 3 Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering... Let us always show concerns for the mistreated, the women and men, the youths and the teens...they have no choice, but to run away from their own home which is unsafe, they are not able to pack anything in a hurry, as they are in danger, when they are abused and assaulted because of family violence.

想想那些囚犯。我们可能会认为他们是罪犯，他们是犯罪分子、他们杀人、他们伤害人、他们殴打人... 甚至是自己的妻子、自己的孩子...难道他们不应该被关在监狱里吗，为什么他们值得怜悯和接待，为什么他们值得牧师和传道人的探访？

Think about the prisoners. Well, we may think they are the offenders, they are the criminals, they kill people, they hurt people, they bash people... their wife, their children... don't they deserve being locked up behind bar, why do they deserve mercy and hospitality, why do they deserve visits from chaplains and pastors.

作为一个忙碌的教区牧师，我也曾担任监狱牧师。我每周花一天时间开车很远的路去监狱探访囚犯。我的一些教友抱怨并且不理解为什么我不去探访富有的教友，去给他们留下好印象以获得更多的奉献和给予，为什么要在那些被遗弃的和可鄙的人身上浪费时间？为什么，你知道为什么吗...因为我非常认真地对待耶稣的命令和教导。在马太福音第25章，我们听到这样的话：有一天耶稣将坐在天国的宝座上，分开绵羊和山羊，有些被放在右边，有些在左边...谈到山羊，耶稣责备说：「你们这被咒诅的人，离开我！进入那为魔鬼和他的使者所预备的永火里去！因为我饿了，你们不给我吃，渴了，你们不给我喝；我作客旅，你们不留我住；我赤身露体，你们不给我穿；我病了，我在监里，你们不来看顾我。」... 耶稣说：「我实在告诉你们，这些事你们既不做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是不做在我身上了。」（马太福音25:43, 45）

Being very busy as a parish priest I also worked as a prison chaplain. I took a day each week to drive a long way to visit the inmates in a prison. Some of my parishioners complaint and couldn't understand why I didn't visit the wealthy parishioners, to impress them for more offerings and givings, why to waste time on those outcasts and the despicable? Why, do you know why... because I take Jesus' commands and teachings very seriously. On Matthew's Gospel chapter 25, we hear this: One day Jesus will sit on his throne in heavenly glory, dividing the sheep and the goats, some were put on the right, and some on the left... speaking of the goats, Jesus rebuked 'depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you did not invite me in. I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me... Jesus said, I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' (Matthew 25:43, 45)

谁是最小的，谁是那些我们最不愿意服事、关心、与之交谈的人。我们是否应该额外努力去与他们联系，与他们交往，理解他们...正如耶稣带着爱认同他们一样。

Who are the least, who are those we feel least willing to serve, to care, to talk with. Should we make some extra effort to connect with them, to associate with them, to understand them... as Jesus identifies with them lovingly.

我們該服事最小，但也該尊敬那些忠心不倦地服事神的人，就像今天坐在这里的你们中的许多人一样。想一想那教會裡的教牧人員吧？作为任何一个被按立的或平信徒传道人，就像任何公众人物一样，他或她都面临着各种谣言、怀疑和指控的风险。作为一个以正直做神工作的牧师，作为一个带着神的心肠和神的呼召传道的传道人，作为一个真正的基督徒，单纯地在各行各业中服事和顺服神，难道他们不值得尊重和理解吗？难道他们不需要支持和肯定吗？希伯来书13:7-8 从前引导你们、传神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。耶稣基督昨日、今日、一直到永远，是一样的。

Serve the least, and also honor the noble, the people who serve God so faithfully and tirelessly, like many of you sitting here today. How about those who are licensed to minister. As any a ordained or a lay minister, like any public figure, he or she is at risk of all rumours, suspicions and accusations. Being a clergy doing God's work with integrity, being a preacher preaching with God's heart and God's calling, being a authentic Christian, simply serve and obey God in every walk, don't they deserve respect and understanding? Don't they require support and affirmation? Hebrews 13:7-8 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.

耶稣一直是慈爱、公義、無瑕和完美的。我们希望所有教會领袖都为耶稣做好自己，所有基督教领袖都清楚纯洁地讲述神的话语。对我来说，我喜欢听好的讲道，但我更喜欢听一个品行、举止和行为都良好的传道人，一個过着真誠基督徒生活、展现基督教道德的传道人，一個敬虔品格是持续、不断、不變和一致的传道人。圣经要求我们留心看他们为人的结局，效法他们的信心。

Jesus is always the same loving and right and correct and perfect. We wish all Christians leaders are doing well for Jesus, and all Christian leaders are speaking clearly and purely the word of God. For me, I like to listen to good sermons, but I like it more, to listen to a preacher with good conduct, good manner and good behaviour, who lives a authentic Christian life, who demonstrates Christian morals, whose godly character continuous, ongoing, constant and consistent. The Bible asks us to consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.

多年来，我在生活和事工的艰难时期一直勇敢和坚韧。我保持忠心和喜乐，因为我知道「主是我的帮助，我必不惧怕；人能把我怎么样呢？」

I have been courageous and resilient over the years of tough time in life and in ministry. I continue being faithful and joyful, as I know "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?"

这里的作者与大卫王在诗篇56:9-13中的话相呼应，当他被非利士人包围和攻击时，他信靠神并祷告：「我呼求的日子，我的仇敌都要转身退后。神帮助我，这是我所知道的。我倚靠神，我要赞美他的话；我倚靠耶和华，我要赞美他的话。我倚靠神，必不惧怕。人能把我怎么样呢？」大卫对神的信心建立在他与神的经历上...就像我，或者像你一样，大卫能够一次又一次地见证神在他需要帮助时的立即同在，特别是当他被别人恐吓和骚扰时，当他处于危险和许多困难中时，大卫作见证说...人能把我怎么样呢...因为你救我的命脱离死亡。你岂不是救护我的脚不跌倒，使我在生命光中行在神面前吗？

The author here echoes with King David on Psalm 56:9-13, when he was surrounded and attacked by the Philistines, he trusted God and prayed, 'Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me. In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise- In God I trust, I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?' David's faith in God built on his experience with God... like me, or like you, David could witness again and again God's immediate presence when he needed help, particularly when he was intimidated and harassed by others, when he was in danger and lots of troubles, David testified this... What can man do to me... for you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.

诗篇118:6-8："耶和华向着我，我必不惧怕，人能把我怎么样呢？在那帮助我的人中，有耶和华帮助我，所以我要看见那恨我的人遭报。"

Psalm 118:6-8 'The Lord is with me, I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? The Lord is with me, he is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies.'

所以朋友们，信靠神，信靠耶稣，总要记得基督是至高者：「我们应当靠着耶稣，常常以颂赞为祭献给神，这就是那承认主名之人嘴唇的果子。只是不可忘记行善和捐输的事，因为这样的祭是神所喜悦的。」

So friends, trust God and trust Jesus, always remember the Supremacy of Christ: 'Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.'

最后以美好的祝福结束：「但愿赐平安的神，就是那凭永约之血、使群羊的大牧者我主耶稣从死里复活的神，在各样善事上成全你们，叫你们遵行他的旨意；又借着耶稣基督在你们心里行他所喜悦的事。愿荣耀归给他，直到永永远远。阿们！"

And the wonderful benediction to conclude: 'Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.'

**阿们 | Amen**
