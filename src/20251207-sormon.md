Romans 15:4–13 & Message（中英对照）
罗马书 15:4–13（中英对照，经文：和合本简体）

4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.
4 从前所写的圣经都是为教训我们写的，叫我们因圣经所生的忍耐和安慰，可以得着盼望。

5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
5 但愿赐忍耐安慰的　神，叫你们彼此同心，效法基督耶稣，

6 so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
6 一心一口荣耀　神，我们主耶稣基督的父。

7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.
7 所以你们要彼此接纳，如同基督接纳你们一样，使荣耀归于　神。

8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
8 我说，基督是为　神真理作了受割礼人的执事，要证实所应许列祖的话；

9 and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:
“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;
I will sing the praises of your name.”
9 并叫外邦人因他的怜悯荣耀　神。如经上所记：
“因此我要在外邦中称赞你，歌颂你的名。”

10 Again, it says, “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
10 又说：
“外邦啊，你们当与主的百姓一同欢乐。”

11 And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him.”
11 又说：
“外邦啊，你们当赞美主！万民哪，你们都当颂赞他！”

12 And again, Isaiah says, “The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.”
12 又有以赛亚说：
“将来有耶西的根，就是那兴起来要治理外邦的；外邦人要仰望他。”

13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
13 但愿使人有盼望的　神，因信将诸般的喜乐平安充满你们的心，使你们借着圣灵的能力大有盼望。

信息分享（中英文对照）
Advent Candles and the Broken World（将临期的烛光与破碎的世界）

The Advent candles represent hope, peace, joy, and love that come with the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Christmas is around the corner, shops are getting crowded with people doing Christmas shopping.
将临期的烛光象征主耶稣降生所带来的盼望、平安、喜乐与爱。圣诞节将近，商店里挤满了忙于采购的人们。

We would think the world should become better with each Christmas reminding us “Emmanuel, God with us”. Yet the world remains broken—with wars, violence, killing, shooting, stabbing, cheating, and lying.
我们本以为随着每一个提醒我们“以马内利，神与我们同在”的圣诞来到，世界应当变得更美好。然而现实仍旧破碎：战争、暴力、杀戮、枪击、刺伤、欺骗、谎言仍然充斥世界。

Violence in Society（社会中的暴力）

We still remember the horrifying assassination of Charlie Kirk on 10 September this year — political violence in a university during what should have been peaceful exchange of ideas. A brilliant young life was taken by a senseless bullet.
我们仍记得今年 9 月 10 日 Charlie Kirk 遭暗杀的震惊事件 —— 一场本应是自由表达与讨论的大学户外活动，却发生了政治暴力。一位杰出的青年被无意义的子弹夺走生命。

We cannot understand or condone such shootings. Even more shocking, violence has appeared in our Victorian schools — such as the recent stabbing of an 8-year-old by an 11-year-old in Brentwood Park Primary School.
我们无法理解或容忍这样的枪击事件。更令人震惊的是，暴力竟然出现在维州学校——如最近 Brentwood Park 小学，一名 11 岁学生用厨房刀刺伤 8 岁学生。

We ask: what is happening to our world, to Australia, to Melbourne? Can we truly experience the hope, peace, joy, and love Jesus brings?
我们不禁要问：世界怎么了？澳大利亚怎么了？墨尔本怎么了？我们真的能经历耶稣所带来的盼望、平安、喜乐与爱吗？

Hope from Scripture and Christ（从圣经与基督来的盼望）

Romans 15:4 reminds us that Scripture gives endurance and encouragement so that we may have hope.
罗马书 15:4 提醒我们，圣经赐忍耐和安慰，使我们可以得着盼望。

Our circumstances may feel hopeless, but in Christ we are full of hope.
环境或许令人绝望，但在基督里我们充满盼望。

God is faithful to His promise to Israel despite their failures, and likewise merciful to the Gentiles who had no initial connection with the Jewish people. God’s mercy and faithfulness are for all — Jews, Gentiles, Christians, and non-Christians.
尽管以色列屡屡失败，神仍信守应许；神也向原本与犹太群体毫无关联的外邦人施怜悯。神的怜悯与信实是给所有人的——犹太人、外邦人、基督徒与非基督徒。

Unity in the Church（教会中的合一）

The early Roman church had political and cultural divisions, debates, and conflicts. Paul urged them to drop such arguments and worship with one mind and one voice, glorifying God.
初代罗马教会充满政治与文化分歧、各种争论与冲突。保罗劝他们放下争执，以同心同声荣耀神。

To glorify God is to help others and ourselves see Him more clearly—like a telescope magnifies the beauty of the planets.
荣耀神，就是帮助别人、也帮助自己更清楚地看见祂——就像望远镜让我们看到星球的壮丽。

Welcoming One Another（彼此接纳）

As a church, we glorify God by welcoming one another, just as Christ welcomed us. Jesus came as a servant to confirm God’s truth and extend mercy to both Jews and Gentiles.
作为教会，我们通过彼此接纳来荣耀神，正如基督接纳我们一样。耶稣道成肉身，为证实神的真理，并把怜悯临到犹太人与外邦人。

When Christians behave with Christlike love—sharing the Gospel, inviting others, showing genuine care—outsiders will be drawn to Christ.
当基督徒活出基督的爱——分享福音、邀请他人、真诚相爱——外人会被吸引，愿意走进教会。

Spurgeon’s Exhortation（司布真牧师的劝勉）

Spurgeon once preached that Christ did not welcome us because we were perfect but out of loving condescension, covering our faults and seeking our good—so we must welcome one another the same way.
司布真曾说，基督并非因我们完美而接纳我们，而是以慈爱谦卑遮盖我们的软弱、寻求我们的益处——因此我们也当如此彼此接纳。

Harmony in Diversity（多元社会中的和谐）

Paul was concerned for the well-being and conversion of the Gentiles. When Jewish and Gentile Christians worship together, will they get along?
保罗关心外邦人的得救与成长。当犹太与外邦信徒同在一间教会敬拜时，他们能否彼此相处？

In our multicultural society — with different upbringings, accents, and customs — can we still aim for harmony?
在多元文化的社会、各种成长背景与口音中，我们是否仍能追求和谐？

Immigration and Sharing（移民议题与分享）

We see anti-immigration protests and counter-protests. Are we afraid resources will be taken? Or do we trust that God provides enough for us to share, not monopolize?
我们看到反移民抗议，也看到反对反移民的抗议。我们害怕资源被夺走？还是相信神的供应足够，让我们学习分享而非霸占？

Paul quotes Isaiah: the Root of Jesse will rise, the one in whom the Gentiles will hope, rejoice, and praise God.
保罗引用以赛亚的话：耶西的根要兴起，外邦人要仰望祂、在祂里欢喜、赞美神。

Christ for All Nations（基督是万国的救主）

Jesus, the Root of Jesse, descendant of Abraham and son of David, was born in Bethlehem. His ministry began among the Jews, yet His salvation is for all nations.
耶稣——耶西的根、亚伯拉罕的后裔、大卫的子孙——生于伯利恒，起初在犹太人中事奉，但祂的救恩是给万国的。

Though the world is divided, Christ gives us hope that one day with one mind and one voice, all the earth will glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
纵然世界分裂，基督让我们怀着盼望：终有一天，全地将同心合一荣耀我们主耶稣基督的父。

Benediction（祝福）

Let us end with Paul’s blessing to the Romans:
让我们以保罗给罗马教会的祝福作结束：

“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.”
“但愿使人有盼望的　神，因信将诸般的喜乐平安充满你们的心，使你们借着圣灵的能力大有盼望。”

Amen.
阿们。
