Haggai 1:15b–2:9

六月二十四日，耶和华的灵感动了犹大省的督造所罗巴伯和大祭司约书亚，并激动余民，他们就来建造耶和华的殿。（1:15b）
七月二十一日，耶和华的话借先知哈该临到说：
“你要对犹大省的督造所罗巴伯、大祭司约书亚，并余下的百姓说：‘谁还记得这殿在先前的荣耀呢？如今看怎样呢？在你们眼中不也算一无所有吗？
但现在你们要刚强，所罗巴伯！’这是万军之耶和华说的。‘你们要刚强，大祭司约书亚！你们全地的民都要刚强！’这是耶和华说的，‘你们要作工，因为我与你们同在。
这是我从埃及领你们出来与你们立约时所应许的，我的灵仍在你们中间；所以不要惧怕。’
万军之耶和华如此说：‘再过片时，我必震动天地、海和旱地；我必震动万国，使万国所羡慕的都来到，我必使这殿充满荣耀。
银子是我的，金子也是我的，这是万军之耶和华说的。
这殿后来的荣耀必大过先前的荣耀，这是万军之耶和华说的。在这地方，我必赐平安，这是万军之耶和华说的。’”

On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai:
“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people. Ask them, ‘Who of you is left who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Does it not seem to you like nothing?
But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord. ‘Be strong, Joshua son of Jozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the Lord, ‘and work. For I am with you,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And my Spirit remains among you. Do not fear.
This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In a little while I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and what is desired by all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord Almighty.
‘The silver is mine and the gold is mine,’ declares the Lord Almighty. ‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the Lord Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the Lord Almighty.’

##  背景 Background

回想巴比伦的河边吗？以色列的被掳民或战争俘虏，被巴比伦人抓走，他们被迫在河边辛勤劳作，帮助巴比伦人重建被毁的城镇和城市。
这是神子民的羞辱和痛苦，他们原本蒙福，但因长期的悖逆和不顺服而受苦。然而，神是怜悯和慈爱的。《诗篇》30:4–5说：

“你们要向耶和华歌唱，赞美他的圣名。因为他的怒气不过是转眼之间，他的恩典却是一生之久；哭泣可能逗留一夜，欢呼却在清晨到来。”

通过耶利米、以赛亚、以西结、但以理等先知（称为“前被掳先知”），他们预言了被掳作为惩罚，同时也应许未来的恢复。巴比伦被掳于公元前605年开始，历时70年，到公元前538年神按时使居鲁士王颁布法令，允许犹太人回到耶路撒冷，重建圣殿。

Remember the Rivers of Babylon? The Israelite exiles or war prisoners were captured by the Babylonians, forced to labor along the rivers to help rebuild their towns and cities.
This was a time of shame and humiliation for God’s people, chosen for blessings but suffering due to their prolonged disobedience and rebellion. Yet God is merciful and gracious. Psalm 30:4–5 says:

“Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; praise his holy name. For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.”

Through pre-exilic prophets like Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, God foretold exile as punishment, yet promised future restoration. The Babylonian exile began around 605 BC, lasting 70 years, and ended in 538 BC when King Cyrus issued a decree allowing the Jews to return and rebuild the Temple.

##  解经与讲道内容 Commentary & Reflection

哈该书的主题是呼召归回的犹太人重建神的殿，重新把神的工作置于个人利益之上。
归回的百姓最初动工建殿，但很快停下来，因为受到阻碍，同时他们更关注自己的房屋建设，认为舒适的家比神的荣耀更重要。

哈该直言指出这种自私思想：“你们自己安居房屋的时候，这殿仍然荒凉，不是时候吗？”（哈该 1:4）
神通过哈该提醒，经济困境与内心不安，是因为优先顺序错误，把神放在最后。

“你们种了许多，却收获甚少。吃却不饱，喝却不满，穿却不暖，得的工价放在漏口袋里。”（哈该 1:6）
“你们期待多，结果却少，因为我的殿仍荒凉，而你们各人忙于自己的房屋。”（哈该 1:9）

当百姓回应先知呼召，开始建殿时，神应许与他们同在：“我与你们同在”，并赐鼓励与力量（哈该 1:13–15）。

The main theme of Haggai is a powerful call to the returning exiles to rebuild God’s house and prioritize His work over their own interests.
The returning Jews initially began rebuilding the Temple but stopped, discouraged and focused on their own homes. Haggai confronted this selfishness: “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?” (Haggai 1:4)

God linked their economic hardship and lack of inner peace to misplaced priorities.

“You have planted much, but harvested little. You eat, but never have enough. You drink, but never have your fill. You put on clothes, but are not warm. You earn wages, only to put them in a purse with holes in it.” (Haggai 1:6)
“You expected much, but see, it turned out to be little. Because my house remains a ruin, while each of you is busy with your own house.” (Haggai 1:9)

When the people obeyed and began to work, God encouraged them with His presence: “I am with you,” giving strength and peace (Haggai 1:13–15).

##  应用 Application

圣徒们，我们为主的劳动不会徒然，神会通过同在赐福。面对未来的不确定，可能感到软弱或失落，但神的话是：
“刚强……工作……我与你们同在……不要惧怕……在此地我要赐平安。”
优先顺序：神在首，神的工作在先。遵守神的命令，就能在困境中经历神的同在与平安。

Beloved, our labor for the Lord is not in vain; God blesses us through His presence.
Facing uncertainty, weakness, or discouragement, God says:
“Be strong… work… I am with you… do not fear… in this place I will grant peace.”
Priority must be God first, His work above all. Obeying God ensures His presence and peace even in trials.

##  祷告 Prayer

天父，感谢你呼召我们优先看重你，重建你家。求你赐我们刚强的心、顺服的灵，使我们经历你的同在与平安。奉主耶稣基督的名，阿们。

Father, thank You for calling us to prioritize You and rebuild Your house. Grant us strength, obedience, and Your presence, so we may experience Your peace. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
