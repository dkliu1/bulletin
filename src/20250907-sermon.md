**腓利门书 1章（和合本）**

¹为基督耶稣被囚的<u>保罗</u>，同兄弟<u>提摩太</u>，²写信给我们所亲爱的同工<u>腓利门</u>，并亲爱的姊妹<u>亚腓亚</u>和与我们同当兵的<u>亚基布</u>，以及在你家的教会。³愿恩惠、平安从神我们的父和主<u>耶稣基督</u>归与你们！

⁴我祷告的时候提到你，常为你感谢我的神，⁵因听说你向主<u>耶稣</u>和众圣徒有爱心，有信心。⁶愿你与人所同有的信心显出功效，使人知道你们各样善事都是为<u>基督</u>做的。⁷兄弟啊，我为你的爱心大有快乐，大得安慰，因众圣徒的心从你得了畅快。

⁸我虽然靠着<u>基督</u>能放胆吩咐你合宜的事，⁹然而像我这有年纪的<u>保罗</u>，现在又是为<u>基督耶稣</u>被囚的，宁可凭着爱心求你，¹⁰就是为我在捆锁中所生的儿子<u>阿尼西母</u>求你。¹¹他从前与你没有益处，但如今与你我都有益处。¹²我现在打发他亲自回你那里去，他是我心上的人。¹³我本来有意将他留下，在我为福音所受的捆锁中替你伺候我。¹⁴但不知道你的意思，我就不愿意这样行，叫你的善行不是出于勉强，乃是出于甘心。¹⁵他暂时离开你，或者是叫你永远得着他，¹⁶不再是奴仆，乃是高过奴仆，是亲爱的兄弟。在我实在是如此，何况在你呢！这也不拘是按肉体说，是按主说。

¹⁷你若以我为同伴，就收纳他，如同收纳我一样。¹⁸他若亏负你，或欠你什么，都归在我的账上。¹⁹我<u>保罗</u>亲笔写：我必偿还。这也不用我对你说，连你自己也是亏欠于我。²⁰兄弟啊，望你使我在主里因你得快乐，并望你使我的心在<u>基督</u>里得畅快。²¹我写信给你，深信你必顺服，知道你所要行的必过于我所说的。

²²此外，你还要给我预备住处，因为我盼望借着你们的祷告，必蒙恩到你们那里去。²³为<u>基督耶稣</u>与我同坐监的<u>以巴弗</u>问你安。²⁴与我同工的<u>马可</u>、<u>亚里达古</u>、<u>底马</u>、<u>路加</u>也都问你安。²⁵愿我们主<u>耶稣基督</u>的恩常在你的心里。阿们！

**Philemon 1 (NIV)**

¹Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—²also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home: ³Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

⁴I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, ⁵because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. ⁶I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. ⁷Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord's people.

⁸Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, ⁹yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—¹⁰that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains. ¹¹Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.

¹²I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. ¹³I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. ¹⁴But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. ¹⁵Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—¹⁶no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord.

¹⁷So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. ¹⁸If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. ¹⁹I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. ²⁰I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. ²¹Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.

²²And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. ²³Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. ²⁴And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. ²⁵The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

我想知道，当你们来到或开车经过这间教会时，什么最吸引你们的眼球。对于我们一些来自亚洲国家的人来说，一座历史悠久的教堂建筑坐落在一大片土地上，有着宽敞的停车场，旁边还有一座牧师住宅，这实在是相当令人惊叹的……因为在我来自的地方，比如香港，大多数教会都位于公寓楼里。例如，在一栋30层的建筑中，可能有5或6个不同宗派的教会坐落其中，供任何寻找教会的人搭乘电梯到正确的楼层，选择适合自己的教会。

I wonder what catches your eyes when you come in or drive past this church. For some of us who come from an Asian country, a historic church building on a big piece of land with a big car park and also a vicarage on its adjacent side is quite amazing ....as most churches , say in HK where I came from, are situated in a apartment. In a building of 30 storeys for example, there may be 5 or 6 different churches of different denominations sitting there for any church hunters to take a elevator , to go onto the right floor and to choose the right church for themselves.

你们现在所在的教会，St David's Moorabbin，当然有一些独特的特色……最让我和其他一些人印象深刻的，可能是沿着Nepean高速公路的那个大教会标志，上面写着"要以恩慈相待，彼此饶恕，正如神在<u>基督</u>里饶恕了你们一样"。使徒<u>保罗</u>在哥林多前书15:10中说："然而，我今日成了何等人，是蒙神的恩才成的，我蒙了恩典，我有特权被呼召来服事……祂的恩典，祂对我的饶恕并非徒然。"因为我们是因恩典得救，蒙了饶恕，我们是在<u>基督耶稣</u>里造的新人，为要行善事，所以要以恩慈相待，彼此饶恕，正如神在我们悔改认罪时饶恕我们一样。

The church you are in now, St David's Moorabbin has a few unique features of course ....what impress me and a few others most, could be the big church sign along Nepean highway, which says ' Be kind and forgiving as God forgives you ' St Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15: 10 ' But by the grace of God I am what I am, I am forgiven and I am privileged to be called to serve... his grace , his forgiveness to me was not without effect. ' For it is by grace that we have been saved and forgiven, we are a new creation created in Christ Jesus to do good works, so be kind and forgiving as God forgives us whenever we repent and confess.

在腓利门书中，使徒<u>保罗</u>写信给住在歌罗西的富有基督徒<u>腓利门</u>，他是一位享有声望的罗马公民。在这封信中，<u>保罗</u>要求<u>腓利门</u>饶恕！饶恕你那个逃跑的奴隶<u>阿尼西母</u>，他偷了你的东西后逃走了。

In the book of Philemon, the Apostle Paul was writing to a wealthy Christian Philemon, who lived in Colossae as a prestigious Roman citizen. In his letter, Paul asks Philemon to forgive! Forgive your slave Onesimus who had run away, after he had stolen from you.

这个小偷，这个<u>阿尼西母</u>，成了逃犯，他逃到罗马，在那里遇到了<u>保罗</u>，成为了基督徒，并开始在<u>保罗</u>的事工中帮助他（歌罗西书4:9 <u>阿尼西母</u>，基督里忠心亲爱的弟兄）。

This thief, this Onesimus, became a fugitive and he had fled to Rome, where he encountered Paul, became a Christian, and started helping Paul in his ministry ( Col 4: 9 Onesimus , a faithful and dear brother in Christ )

按照罗马法，<u>保罗</u>想要把<u>阿尼西母</u>送回<u>腓利门</u>那里。但根据同样的法律，奴隶主有权惩罚或处决逃跑的奴隶。因此<u>保罗</u>写信给<u>腓利门</u>，提出了一个微妙的请求：像欢迎<u>保罗</u>一样欢迎<u>阿尼西母</u>回来，不是把他当作逃跑的奴隶，而是当作弟兄（第17节）。我们知道<u>保罗</u>作为牧师，就像父亲对待他所爱的孩子们一样。帖撒罗尼迦前书2:11："你们也晓得，我们怎样劝勉你们，安慰你们，嘱咐你们各人，好像父亲待自己的儿女一样，要叫你们行事对得起那召你们进他国、得他荣耀的神。"

Paul wanted to send Onesimus back to Philemon as required by Roman law. But by the same law, slaveowners had the right to punish or execute runaway slaves. So Paul wrote to Philemon with a delicate request: welcome Onesimus back as he would welcome Paul, not as a runaway slave but as a brother (v. 17). As we know Paul, being a pastor, is like a father for his beloved children. 1 Thessalonians 2: 11 for you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.

在罗马，<u>保罗</u>可能用我们主<u>耶稣基督</u>的福音感化了<u>阿尼西母</u>，<u>保罗</u>可能告诉<u>阿尼西母</u><u>耶稣</u>如何为我们的罪而死，<u>耶稣</u>如何付了我们的赎价，本应受罪的惩罚的我们，<u>耶稣</u>却担当了我们的刑罚，祂承担了我们的代价，把我们从羁押中保释出来，在控诉者面前为我们辩护，当祂——<u>耶稣基督</u>这位救主、救赎主和弥赛亚，神的儿子、神自己——为我们付了罪的终极代价时，祂饶恕了我们，使我们称义，因为祂在各各他的十字架上受苦、受创伤、流血至死。

In Rome, Paul might have converted Onesimus with the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, Paul might have told Onesimus how Jesus died for our sins, how Jesus paid our ransom , that instead of us being punished as sinners, Jesus bore our punishment, he took our penalty, bailed us out from custody , defended us in front of the prosecutors, forgave and justified us when he, Jesus Christ the Savior, Redeemer and Messiah, the Son of God and God himself, paid the ultimate price of sins for us , as he suffered, traumatised and bled to die on the cross in Calvary.

被饶恕的生命意味着新的、不同的生命。这意味着一个被改变的生命和一个方向相反的生命。做一个180度的转弯。我们曾经走在错误的路上，所以我们需要完全转向正确的路上。当我们拒绝<u>耶稣</u>时我们迷失了，但现在我们被找到了，我们敬拜和服事<u>耶稣</u>。

A forgiven life means a new and different life. It means a transformed life and a life with a opposite direction. Make a u turn. We were on the wrong side of the road, so we need to turn around all the way to the right side of the road. We were lost when we refused Jesus , but now we are found and we worship and serve Jesus .

记住约翰福音第8章，<u>耶稣</u>赦免了那个犯奸淫的妇人。<u>耶稣</u>问："没有人定你的罪吗？""没有敢定你罪、用石头打你的罪人吗？"妇人回答说："主啊，没有。""我也不定你的罪，"<u>耶稣</u>宣告说，<u>耶稣</u>又加上，"去吧，从此不要再犯罪了……去吧，不要再犯罪了。"

Remember on John 8, when Jesus acquitted the woman who had committed adultery. Jesus asked ' has no one condemned you ?'' none of the sinners who dare to convict you and stone you ? ' the woman answered ' no Sir' ' Then neither do I condemn you' declared Jesus, and Jesus added, ' Go now and leave your life of sin... go now and sin no more '

<u>保罗</u>显然在<u>阿尼西母</u>身上下了很大功夫，要求他承认和忏悔自己的罪，接受和感激<u>基督</u>的救恩，为神的饶恕感谢神，但不要再犯罪，不要再偷盗，不要再隐藏。一个被饶恕的人仍然需要承担他罪恶的某些后果，他或她必须道歉，偿还，补偿，为对他人造成的损害、伤害和痛苦感到悔恨，所有被饶恕的罪人都必须下定决心，这样的恶行和错误行为不应该再做，不应该再重复。

Paul apparently had worked hard on Onesimus, asked him to admit and confess his sins , accepted and appreciated Christ' Salvation , thank God for his forgiveness, but sin no more, steal no more, and hide no more. A forgiven person still needs to bear certain kinds of consequences of his sins , he or she has to apologize, to pay back, to compensate , to feel remorse of the damages and hurt and pain done to others, and all forgiven sinners have to make up their mind that, such bad crime and wrong behaviour should not be done and repeated again.

新归信的<u>阿尼西母</u>可能通过<u>保罗</u>的深刻之爱和牧养关怀而改变和转化，但主要是通过圣灵的动态改造力量。现在<u>阿尼西母</u>同意回到他的主人<u>腓利门</u>那里，道歉并归还偷来的物品，冒着被当局举报和逮捕的风险。相信<u>阿尼西母</u>现在是一个真正的基督徒，<u>保罗</u>要求<u>腓利门</u>请饶恕他，收留他，不要对他提出任何刑事指控。

The newly converted Onesimus might have changed and transformed through Paul's profound love and pastoral care, but primarily through the dynamic transformation power of the Holy Spirit. Now Onesimus has agreed to go back to his master Philemon, , to apologize and to return the stolen items, risking himself to be reported and arrested by the authorities . Trusting Onesimus is now a genuine Christian, Paul asked Philemon to please forgive him, take him back and would not press any criminal charges against him.

在这封信中，<u>保罗</u>基于<u>基督</u>的爱向<u>腓利门</u>恳求。<u>保罗</u>温和地劝说，无条件地为<u>阿尼西母</u>恳求爱的饶恕。<u>保罗</u>甚至愿意偿还<u>阿尼西母</u>所欠的任何债务，这有力地展示了福音替代、<u>基督</u>牺牲的挽回和赎罪的原则。<u>保罗</u>以很大的个人代价在<u>腓利门</u>和<u>阿尼西母</u>之间充当调解人/和平缔造者……正如<u>基督</u>在神和所有罪人之间充当调解人/和平缔造者一样……神是如此愿意通过<u>基督</u>的救赎来饶恕我们。

In his letter, Paul made a plea to Philemon on the basis of Christ's love. Paul gently persuaded and appealed a loving forgiveness for Onesimus unconditionally. Paul even offered to repay any debt Onesimus owes, a powerful demonstration of the Gospel's principle of substitution, propitiation by Christ's sacrifice and atonement. Paul acted as a mediator / peacemaker between Philemon and Onesimus with much personal costs... just as Christ acted as The Mediator / Peacemaker between God and all sinners... God is so ready to forgive us through Christ's redemption.

<u>保罗</u>敦促<u>腓利门</u>接纳<u>阿尼西母</u>不是作为奴隶，而是"不再是奴仆，乃是高过奴仆，是亲爱的兄弟"（腓利门书1:16）。这个革命性的想法表明，在<u>基督</u>里，主人和奴隶现在作为同一属灵家庭的成员处于平等地位。在<u>基督</u>里，社会地位没有差别，没有颐指气使，没有骄傲的等级制度。我们确实有不同的角色或不同的头衔，但我们在<u>基督</u>里都是被重视和平等的。<u>基督</u>接纳我们进入祂的家中，不是作为仆人或奴隶，而是作为祂父亲的爱子，拥有所有属世的祝福和永恒的产业。

Paul urges Philemon to receive Onesimus not as a slave, but "no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother" (Philemon 1:16). This revolutionary idea shows that in Christ, both master and slave are now on equal footing as members of the same spiritual family. In Christ, there is no difference in social status, no bossing around and no prideful hierarchy . We do have different roles or different titles, but we are all valued and equal in Christ. Christ has received us in his household, not as a servant or slave, but as His Father's beloved children with all earthly blessings and eternal inheritance.

<u>耶稣</u>一再强调饶恕他人的重要性（马太福音6:14-15）：¹⁴你们饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必饶恕你们的过犯；¹⁵你们不饶恕人的过犯，你们的天父也必不饶恕你们的过犯。

Jesus repeatedly spoke of the importance of forgiving others (Matt. 6:14-15): ¹⁴For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ¹⁵But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

我们从神那里得到的恩典和饶恕应该延伸到他人身上。这表明真正的饶恕不仅仅是继续前行，而是关于我们作为被饶恕者如何过新生活的根本改变，以及我们如何看待和对待其他罪人，我们应该如何饶恕他们，对他们施恩……尽量不要怀恨，不要记录他们的过错。

The grace and forgiveness we receive from God should be extended to others. It shows that true forgiveness is not just about moving on, but about a fundamental change in how we live a new life as the one being forgiven, and how we view and treat other sinners, how we should forgive them and be gracious to them..., try not to hold any grudges, and try not to keep any record of their wrongs.

<u>保罗</u>把<u>腓利门</u>和<u>阿尼西母</u>之间的事情不仅仅看作是私人事务，而是看作属于整个教会的事情（第2节）。除了问候之外，他使用第二人称复数代词，表示他所说的不仅仅是对<u>腓利门</u>。我们的个人生活不是私人的；它们是教会生活的一部分。我们需要在所有教会关系中建立饶恕的文化，在教友之间，在教牧人员之间，在彼此之间。饶恕犯罪者是绝对必要的，但请记住，犯罪者应该首先通过世界的救赎主<u>耶稣基督</u>寻求神的饶恕。

Paul treats the matter between Philemon and Onesimus not just as a private matter, but as one that belongs to the entire church (v. 2). Apart from the greeting, he uses the second-person plural pronoun, signifying that he is addressing more than Philemon. Our individual lives are not private; they are part of the life of the church. We need to build a culture of forgiveness in all church relationships, amongst the parishioners, amongst the clergy, amongst one another. To forgive the offenders is utterly necessary, but please, the offenders should first seek the forgiveness from God, through Jesus Christ the Redeemer of the world.

在我们所有的事工中，我们都应该在那里见证和宣告<u>基督</u>并他钉十字架。无论我们使用什么福音事工项目：启发课程、属灵四定律、福音桥、生命二路等……无论如何，要有爱心，温和和尊重，建立和谐的关系，我们不能强迫，我们只能祷告和等待，劝说和说服，做好榜样和楷模。愿神帮助我们所有人。阿们。

In all our ministries, we should there witness and proclaim Christ and him crucified. Whether we use any of evangelical programs: the Alpha Course, the 4 Spiritual Rules, the Gospel Bridge, the Two Ways of Life etc... By all means, be loving, gentle and respectful, build harmonious relationships, we can't push or force, we can only pray and wait, persuade and convince, be good examples and role models. May God help us all. Amen .

**阿们 | Amen**
