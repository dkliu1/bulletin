耶利米书 23:1–6（和合本简体 & English）
经文 Jeremiah 23:1–6

1 祸哉，那些残害、赶散我草场之羊的牧人！这是耶和华说的。
“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!” declares the Lord.

2 耶和华以色列的神斥责那些牧养他百姓的牧人如此说：你们赶散我的羊群，并未看顾他们。我必讨你们这行恶的罪。这是耶和华说的。
Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the Lord.

3 我要将我所赶到各国其余的羊招聚出来，领他们归回本圈；他们必生养众多。
“I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number.”

4 我必设立牧人牧养他们，他们不再惧怕、不再惊惶，也不缺少一个。这是耶和华说的。
“I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the Lord.

5 耶和华说：日子将到，我要给大卫兴起一个公义的苗裔；他必掌王权，行事有智慧，在地上施行公平和公义。
“The days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, a King who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land.”

6 在他的日子，犹大必得救，以色列也安然居住。他的名必称为：‘耶和华我们的义。’
“In his days Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. This is the name by which he will be called: The Lord Our Righteous Saviour.”

讲道内容（中英文对照）
主是我们的牧者。祂引导我们走义路。弥赛亚是好牧人。好牧人为羊舍命，甚至为那迷失和软弱的羊舍命。成为肉身的神——我们的救主耶稣基督，是伟大、完美、最好的牧者；祂藉着永约之血成全我们，使我们凡事得力，能遵行祂的旨意。

The Lord is our Shepherd. He guides us in paths of righteousness. The Messiah is the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, even the lost and the sick sheep. The God incarnated, our Saviour Jesus Christ, is the great and best shepherd, who through the blood of the eternal covenant equips us with everything good for doing his will.

如今，牧羊人也被称为“羊务工人”。牧者 / 羊务工人的生活与工作都是为着羊群。根据澳洲统计局（ABS）2022 年数据，全澳大约有 10400 个羊场，约有 117500 名羊务工人，其中约 9500 名在维多利亚州。澳洲全国约有七千万只羊：新州占 38%，维州 21%，西澳 18%，南澳 15%。

Nowadays, shepherds are simply called Sheep Workers. A shepherd or sheep worker lives and works for his sheep. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in 2022, there are around 10,400 sheep farms in Australia, with around 117,500 people employed, about 9,500 of them in Victoria. Australia’s total sheep flock is around 70 million: 38% in NSW, 21% in Victoria, 18% in Western Australia, and 15% in South Australia.

不同于旧约时代牧者时时走在羊群前，如今澳洲的羊群多在大型围栏草场中活动，自由走动。现代牧者的工作包括：1）牧场监测；2）轮流放牧；3）水源管理；4）补充饲料等。牧者有“照顾义务”，若疏忽，便构成虐待动物，是文明社会的刑事罪。在新州，例如虐待动物的最高刑罚为 4.4 万澳元罚款与 / 或 12 个月监禁。

Unlike the Old Testament, where the shepherd constantly led the flock, modern Australian sheep are held in large fenced paddocks, where they move as they like. The work of a modern shepherd includes: 1) Pasture monitoring; 2) Rotational grazing; 3) Water management; 4) Supplementary feeding. Shepherds have a duty of care; negligence that endangers animals is cruelty and a criminal offence. In NSW, penalties can reach a $44,000 fine and/or 12 months’ imprisonment.

那么，若我们失职，没有照顾孩童的义务，会怎样？在新州，若未提供生命必要条件而导致严重危险，可判 5 年以上监禁。

What are the penalties when we fail the duty of care for a child? In New South Wales, failing to provide necessities of life causing danger of serious injury can lead to up to 5 years’ imprisonment or more.

若是牧师、神职人员、教会领袖忽略、伤害、误导或操纵信徒呢？许多人因受伤害、不公、羞辱或教会混乱、争端、丑闻而一生不再回教会。我认识许多信徒，他们对神的信心几乎再也恢复不了。跌人之事在各宗派中都有，圣公会或灵恩派都不例外。

How about a pastor, clergy, or priest who fails to care for parishioners? Many people never return to church after being hurt, misled, discouraged, manipulated, humiliated, or abused by church leaders. I know many Christians whose faith never recovered after witnessing disputes, conflicts, or scandals in churches. There are many stumbling blocks in churches across all denominations, Anglican or Pentecostal alike.

在墨尔本，我亲眼见过一些教会事工完全崩溃，只因牧者站在讲台上不是传讲神的话，而是公开承认自己与会友、辅理、或司琴有婚外情。

In Melbourne, I personally know ministries that collapsed because the pastor stood in the pulpit not to preach God’s word but to confess an affair with a parishioner, a curate, or an organist.

在新加坡，城市丰收教会的康希牧师与领袖因挪用超过五千万新币被定罪；在韩国，汝矣岛纯福音教会的赵镛基牧师则因造成教会损失逾千万美元被判刑。美国也有多位牧师因欺诈疫情纾困金或诈骗年长会友而被定罪。

In Singapore, Pastor Kong Hee of City Harvest Church was convicted in 2015 for misusing over S$50 million. In South Korea, Pastor David Yonggi Cho of Yoido Full Gospel Church was convicted in 2014 for causing the church US$12 million in losses. Many U.S. pastors have been imprisoned for PPP loan fraud or defrauding elderly parishioners.

耶利米书 23 章对这些腐败领袖、假先知、失职牧者发出强烈审判：他们赶散羊群、没有照顾羊群。神说祂必亲自惩罚他们，并兴起好牧人，看顾祂珍贵的羊，使他们得着最好的牧场与养分。

Jeremiah 23 contains a powerful judgment against corrupt leaders, false prophets, and unfaithful shepherds who failed their duty of care. God declares that He will punish them, replace them with good shepherds, and ensure His sheep are cared for and never deprived of nourishment.

然而超越所有好牧人，这里出现完美的弥赛亚预言：神应许从大卫家兴起“公义的苗裔”，一位智慧、公义、施行公平的王。祂保护羊群免受掠夺者、盗贼、野兽的伤害。大牧者领我们到青草地，使我们得着活水，喝了永不再渴。

More than any good human shepherd, this is the perfect Messianic prophecy: God promised to raise a “Righteous Branch” from David’s line—a King who reigns wisely and executes justice. The Messianic King protects the flock from predators, thieves, and wild beasts. The Chief Shepherd leads us to green pastures and gives us living water, after which we never thirst again.

好牧人满有怜悯，会主动寻找那只迷失的羊——穿过荆棘、进入妓院与赌场，甚至进入最黑暗、最污秽之地，为要寻找、拯救那迷失的、完全迷失的。

A good shepherd, full of compassion, actively searches for the one lost sheep—even through bushes and thorns, into brothels and casinos, into the darkest and filthiest places—to seek and save the lost and the very lost.

好牧人按名按性认识每一只羊。祂知道我们忧伤、喜乐、软弱或跌倒。祂昼夜温柔地看顾我们。

A good shepherd knows each sheep by name and nature. He knows when we are sad, glad, good, or not so good. He watches over us day and night, gently and tenderly.

好牧人永不放弃任何一只羊，无论它多病、多弱、多偏离、多悖逆。我们也不该放弃任何人——永远不要说“绝不可能”。不要说某人永不会成为基督徒，也不要说教会永远不能变好。

A good shepherd never gives up on any sheep—no matter how sick, weak, astray, or rebellious. Likewise, we should never give up on anyone. Never say never. Never say someone will never become a Christian, or that our church will never improve.

过去四个月与许多弟兄姐妹同工，你们激励并深深感动了我。我知道圣大卫堂将更坚强，因为神会带回你们的堂主任 Michelle，也已经差派了 Paul 牧师——他们是被神呼召、坚固的好牧人，来牧养、带领、装备你们。

Over the past four months working with many of you, I have been greatly inspired. I know St David’s will become stronger, for God will send back your vicar Michelle, and has sent Rev. Paul—good shepherds called and strengthened by God to nurture, lead, and equip you.

我们感谢神，也愿意成为一群乖顺、良善、不制造纷争的羊群。愿一切为基督的缘故。阿们。

We thank God, and we promise to be a well-behaved flock who will not cause unrest or trouble, for Christ’s sake. Amen.
