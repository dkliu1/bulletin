诗篇 112 篇与义人的福分 | Psalm 112 & The Blessings of the Upright

Psalm 112 1 你们要赞美耶和华！敬畏耶和华，甚喜爱他命令的，这人便为有福！ 1 Praise the LORD. Blessed are those who fear the LORD, who find great delight in his commands.

2 他的后裔在世必强盛；正直人的后代必要蒙福。 2 Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

3 他家中有货物，有钱财；他的公义存到永远。 3 Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.

4 正直人在黑暗中，有光向他发现；他有恩惠，有怜悯，有公义。 4 Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.

5 施恩与人、借贷与人的，这人事情顺利；他被审判的时候要得胜。 5 Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.

6 他永不动摇，义人被记念，直到永远。 6 Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever.

7 他不惧怕凶恶的信息；他心坚定，倚靠耶和华。 7 They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the LORD.

8 他心确定，总不惧怕，直到他看见敌人遭报。 8 Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.

9 他施舍钱财，周济贫穷；他的仁义存到永远。他的角必被高举，大有荣耀。 9 They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.

10 恶人看见便恼恨，必咬牙而消化；恶人的心愿要归灭绝。 10 The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.

哎哟！有什么比被火不间断地焚烧更痛苦呢……？有什么比被虫子不间断地咬噬更可怕呢……？在马可福音 9:48 中……耶稣说：要小心你所看到的，你所观看的，你所阅读的……因为倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就去掉它！你只有一只眼进入神的国，强如有两只眼落入地狱里。在那里的虫是不死的，火是不灭的。哎哟！…… Ouch! What is more painful than being burnt by fire, non-stop…? What is more horrible than being bitten by worms, non-stop….? In Mark 9: 48 ….Jesus said : be careful of what you see, what you watch, what you read…. For if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched. Ouch! ….

圣经从不回避或尴尬地谈论恶人可怕的宿命。恶人如果承认罪孽并承认基督，就不再是恶人。恶人之所以是恶人，是因为他们一直拒绝基督，并拒绝承认自己的罪。恶人不会有好的前途。恶人将看到自己错过了多少。恶人会后悔，但为时已晚。恶人会恼恨，会咬牙而消化……恶人的心愿要归于虚无，绝对的虚无。 The Bible is never shy or embarrassed to talk about the horrible destiny of the wicked. The wicked are not the wicked if they confess sins and confess Christ. The wicked are the wicked if they keep refusing Christ, and keep refusing to admit their sins. The wicked will not have a good future. The wicked will see how much they miss out. The wicked will regret but it will be too late. The wicked will vex, will gnash their teeth and will waste away… the longings of the wicked will come to nothing, absolutely nothing.

“咬牙切齿”不仅仅是牙齿摩擦，也不仅仅是我们在紧张或焦虑时紧咬牙关。圣经中提到的“咬牙”总是与因严厉的审判和惩罚而遭受的极度折磨有关。 "Gnashing of teeth" is not just grinding one's teeth together, it is not just clenching our teeth, when we are a little tense or nervous. Gnashing of teeth mentioned in the Bible always relate with extreme tortures because of severe judgement and punishment.

在新约中，它经常与“哀哭”联系在一起，描述那些被拒于天国之外的人那种情感上的、悔恨的和愤怒的状态。马太福音 8:12……惟有本国的子民（不应用天国价值观的人），被赶到外边黑暗里去，在那里必要哀哭切齿了。马太福音 13:41-42 人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，丢在火炉里；在那里必要哀哭切齿了。 It is frequently linked with "weeping" in the New Testament to describe the emotional, regretful, and angry state of those rejected from the Kingdom. Matthew 8: 12… But the subjects of the kingdom, who don’t apply the kingdom value, will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Matthew 13: 41-42 The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

诗篇 112 篇，如同诗篇 1 篇和圣经的许多篇章一样，非常直接且诚实地告诉我们敬畏上帝的人与不敬畏上帝的人之间的巨大反差。将诗篇 111 篇和 112 篇放在一起看……诗篇 111 篇以“敬畏耶和华是智慧的开端”这一观点结束；而诗篇 112 篇告诉我们敬畏上帝的人所蒙的福分。 Psalm 112 , like Psalm 1 and many parts of the Bible, have been very direct and honest telling us the huge contrast between those who fear God and those who don’t fear God. Putting Psalm 111 and 112 together… Psalm 111 ended with the idea that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; psalm 112 tells us the blessings for those who fear God.

“敬畏”意味着深切的崇敬；也就是说，我们要尊崇上帝，对他心存敬畏。那些敬畏上帝的人也甚喜爱他的命令：我们应当因他的话语和他的作为而感到欢喜。 “fear” means a profound reverence; that is, we are to revere God, and stand in awe of him.” Those who fear God also delight greatly in His commandments: we should be delighted in both his words and his works.

我们渴望幸福的家庭，上帝应许在一个敬畏主的家庭中，后裔将受良好教育，更有甚者，举止端正。 We yearn for a happy family and God promise a happy family with well educated, better so, well behaved descendants in the family, in a family which fears the Lord.

“他家中有货物，有钱财；他的公义存到永远。” 3 Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.

这里指好工作、好雇佣、好生意、有回报的投资、有红利的股票……各种各样的供应，各种各样的天命。但不要做一个无知的财主，我们需要“在神面前富足”（路加福音 12:21），在行善和神面前的正直地位上富足……这样的功德和公义是持久的。它们在今世或来世都不会消逝。 The blessings of good jobs, good employment, good business, investments with returns, shares with dividends… all kinds of provision, all sorts of providence. But don’t be a rich fool, we need Wealth and riches toward God (Luke 12:21). Wealth and riches in doing good works and right standing with God …. Such merits and righteousness are lasting. They will not fade in this world or the world to come.

圣经中出现的希伯来语和希腊语里的“公义/仁义”一词，在这里是指敬畏耶和华之人慷慨的施舍。它指的是取悦我们上帝的善行和周济。 The Hebrew and Greek words for righteousness here and there in the Bible, refers to the generous giving of the man/ woman who fears the LORD. It refers to beneficence and almsgiving which pleases our God.

“施恩与人、借贷与人的，这人事情顺利；他被审判的时候要得胜。” 5 Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.

一个蒙福的人总会从他的财富中分出一部分来给予、分享和借贷。天命使他有能力借出，恩典使他乐意借出。他借出而无需借入，因为上帝已将他提升到那种匮乏之上；他不是囤积者，因为他的新本性救他脱离了那种诱惑和恶习；一个蒙福的人会明智地使用上帝托付给他的金钱。（司布真） A blessed person always spare a little of his wealth he to give, to share and to lend. Providence has made him able to lend, and grace makes him willing to lend. He lends with no need to borrow, for God has lifted him above that necessity; he is not a hoarder, for his new nature saves him from that temptation, and bad habit ; A blessed person wisely uses the money God has entrusted to him.” (Spurgeon)

他将审慎地管理事务：敬畏耶和华的人蒙赐智慧（诗篇 111:10），这种智慧流淌自他敬虔的品格。 He will guide his affairs with discretion: The one who fears the LORD is blessed with wisdom (Psalm 111:10) that flows from his godly character.

“他不惧怕凶恶的信息；他心坚定，倚靠耶和华。他心确定，总不惧怕，直到他看见敌人遭报。他施舍钱财，周济贫穷；他的仁义存到永远。他的角必被高举，大有荣耀。” 7 They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the LORD. 8 Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes. 9 They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn will be lifted high in honor.

因着他敬虔的品格和属天的智慧，敬畏耶和华的人必得坚立。他必蒙尊重。他的名声将长存，不惧怕凶恶的信息。当他倚靠耶和华时，他的心就得以坚固，最终他必蒙称赞和赏赐，他必得胜且凯旋。不惧恶言，不惧凶信。 Because of His godly character and heavenly wisdom, the one who fears the LORD will be firmly established. He will be honored. His remembrance will last, with nothing to fear from evil tidings. As he trusts in the LORD, his heart is established and in the end, he will be well praised and rewarded, he will be triumphant and victorious. No fear of evil tidings, no fear of bad news.

当然在现实生活中，凶恶的信息充斥在我们周围，坏消息可能每天突然降临。来自家庭、健康、事业、不忠诚的人、周遭文化或政治的坏消息。然而，敬畏耶和华的人不会害怕环境，我们是无所畏惧的，我们根本……无所畏惧！ Of course in real life, evil tidings are all around us, bad news may come to us , suddenly, every day. Bad news from our family, from our health, from business, from the unfaithful, from the culture around us, or from politics. Yet the one who fears the LORD will not fear the circumstances, we are fearless , we have simply…. nothing to fear!

神学家迈尔（Meyer）说：“对于一心信靠主的人来说，不可能有凶恶的信息……如果今天疾病、损失、丧亲、死亡的信息传到你那里，只要你的心敢于保持对上帝坚定的信靠，这些信息就不可能是邪恶的；因为这种信靠夺去了死亡的毒钩和坟墓的胜利。我虽不能理解，但我能信靠他。”（迈尔） Theologian Meyer said “There cannot be evil tidings to the soul which has fixed its trust in the Lord…. If tidings were to come to you today of disease, loss, bereavement, death, they could not be evil if your heart dares to maintain a fixed trust in God; for such trust robs death of its sting, and the grave of its victory. I cannot understand, but I can trust Him.” (Meyer)

是恶人还是蒙福的人。是虔诚的人还是不信的人。是在永恒中咬牙切齿，还是与圣徒一同享受筵席。 The wicked or the blessed. The faithful or the faithless. Gnashing the teeth in eternity, or enjoying a feast with the saints.

我亲爱的在线或坐在这里的朋友们：生活充满了选择。愿我们都能仔细且明智地挑选：那正确且最好的选择。奉耶稣的名。阿们！ My dear friends online or sitting here : life is full of choices. May we all pick carefully, and wisely : the right , and the best choice. In Jesus’ name. Amen!
