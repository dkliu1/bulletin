**马太福音 4:12-25（和合本）**

**^12^**<u>耶稣</u>听见<u>约翰</u>下了监,就退到<u>加利利</u>去。**^13^**后又离开<u>拿撒勒</u>,往<u>迦百农</u>去,就住在那里。那地方靠海,在<u>西布伦</u>和<u>拿弗他利</u>的边界上。**^14^**这是要应验先知<u>以赛亚</u>的话,**^15^**说:”<u>西布伦</u>地,<u>拿弗他利</u>地,就是沿海的路,<u>约旦河</u>外,外邦人的<u>加利利</u>地。**^16^**那坐在黑暗里的百姓看见了大光;坐在死荫之地的人有光发现照着他们。”**^17^**从那时候,<u>耶稣</u>就传起道来,说:“天国近了,你们应当悔改!”**^18^**<u>耶稣</u>在<u>加利利</u>海边行走,看见弟兄二人,就是那称呼<u>彼得</u>的<u>西门</u>和他兄弟<u>安得烈</u>,在海里撒网;他们本是打鱼的。**^19^**<u>耶稣</u>对他们说:“来跟从我,我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。”**^20^**他们就立刻舍了网,跟从了他。**^21^**从那里往前走,又看见弟兄二人,<u>西庇太</u>的儿子<u>雅各</u>和他兄弟<u>约翰</u>,同他们的父亲<u>西庇太</u>在船上补网,<u>耶稣</u>就招呼他们。**^22^**他们立刻舍了船,别了父亲,跟从了<u>耶稣</u>。**^23^**<u>耶稣</u>走遍<u>加利利</u>,在各会堂里教训人,传天国的福音,医治百姓各样的病症。**^24^**他的名声就传遍了<u>叙利亚</u>。那里的人把一切害病的,就是害各样疾病、各样疼痛的和被鬼附的、癫痫的、瘫痪的,都带了来,<u>耶稣</u>就治好了他们。**^25^**当下,有许多人从<u>加利利</u>、<u>低加坡里</u>、<u>耶路撒冷</u>、<u>犹太</u>、<u>约旦河</u>外来跟着他。

**Matthew 4:12-25 (NIV)**

**^12^**When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. **^13^**Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali— **^14^**to fulfil what was said through the prophet Isaiah: **^15^**‘Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles— **^16^**the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.’ **^17^**From that time on Jesus began to preach, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.’ **^18^**As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. **^19^**‘Come, follow me,’ Jesus said, ‘and I will send you out to fish for people.’ **^20^**At once they left their nets and followed him. **^21^**Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, **^22^**and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. **^23^**Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and illness among the people. **^24^**News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralysed; and he healed them. **^25^**Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.

当我们买房子时,我们会考虑地点、地点、地点。

When we are buying a house, we consider the location, location, location.

如果我们开始创业,我们也会考虑地点、地点、地点。

If we are starting a business, we think about also the location, location, location.

那个地点是否便利,是否有良好的交通系统,是否有良好的设施和基础设施,是否有足够的人口,成为我们生意的潜在顾客或客户。

The location with convenience, whether there is good transportation system, where they are good facilities, infrastructures, whether there are enough population, being the potential customers or clients for our business.

多年前,当我担任位于唐人街 Little Bouke Street 上 Epiphany 教会的临时宣教士时,Bishop Philip Huggins 谈到了在那个著名而繁忙的地点、地点、地点进行福音事工的巨大机会。

Years ago when I was the interim missioner of the church of Epiphany in Little Bouke Street China Town, Bishop Philip Huggins talked about the vast opportunities of gospel ministry in that prestigious and busy location, location, location.

今天在马太福音第4章的福音经文中,我们读到许多对<u>耶稣</u>事工具有重大意义的地点。**^12^**<u>耶稣</u>听见<u>约翰</u>下了监,就退到<u>加利利</u>去。**^13^**后又离开<u>拿撒勒</u>,往<u>迦百农</u>去,就住在那里。那地方靠海,在<u>西布伦</u>和<u>拿弗他利</u>的边界上。

The Gospel reading today on Matthew chapter 4, we read lots of location which play much significance of Jesus ministry. **^12^**When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. **^13^**Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—

<u>加利利</u>——<u>耶稣</u>早期事工的中心,一个土壤肥沃但湖泊周围有许多山脉的地方……因此有登山宝训、平息风暴、喂饱五千人、在<u>加利利</u>海上行走等等。

Galilee— a centre of Jesus’ early ministry, a location with fertile soil but lots of mountains surrounding the lake… thus sermon on the mount, and calming storms, feeding the 5000, walking on water etc on the sea of Galilee.

<u>拿撒勒</u>——<u>耶稣</u>的家乡,在<u>伯利恒</u>出生后,为躲避大<u>希律</u>王而藏在<u>埃及</u>,<u>马利亚</u>、<u>约瑟</u>和<u>耶稣</u>在<u>拿撒勒</u>定居。

Nazareth— Jesus’ home town, after his birth in Bethlehem then hiding from Herod the Great in Egypt, Mary Joseph and Jesus settled in Nazareth.

<u>迦百农</u>——<u>加利利</u>海边的一个渔村——<u>耶稣</u>离开<u>拿撒勒</u>后事工的大本营——<u>耶稣</u>在那里呼召了他的第一批门徒<u>彼得</u>、<u>安得烈</u>、<u>雅各</u>、<u>约翰</u>和<u>马太</u>,<u>耶稣</u>在那里行了许多神迹。

Capernaum— a fishing village on the sea of Galilee— Jesus’ home base for ministry after leaving Nazareth— Jesus called his first disciples Peter Andrew James John and Matthew there, Jesus performed many miracles there.

<u>西布伦</u>和<u>拿弗他利</u>——地点和地区,环绕<u>加利利</u>海边界,有犹太人和外邦人的混合人口……<u>西布伦</u>和<u>拿弗他利</u>原本是<u>雅各</u>十二个儿子中的两个,因此是<u>以色列</u>十二支派中的两个。在<u>以赛亚书</u>9:1-2中,我们读到预言,这些黑暗之地将看见大光,这预言通过<u>耶稣</u>的事工得以应验,给那里被边缘化的人带来希望和救恩。

Zebulun and Naphtali— locations and a region, border around the sea of Galilee with mixed Jewish and Gentile population… Zebulun and Naphtali were originally 2 of Jacob’s 12 sons, thus 2 of the 12 tribes of Israel. In Isaiah 9:1-2 we read the prophecy that these places of darkness would see a great light, which is fulfilled by Jesus’s ministry bringing hope and salvation to the marginalized people there.

马太福音9:35 “<u>耶稣</u>走遍各城各乡……在会堂里教训人,宣讲天国的福音,医治各样的病症。”

Matthew 9:35 ‘Jesus went through all the towns and villages.. teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.’

<u>耶稣</u>的事工实际上遍及所有地方,主要集中在<u>以色列</u>北部的<u>加利利</u>地区,来自其他地方的人都来到<u>耶稣</u>那里:<u>叙利亚</u>、<u>低加坡里</u>、<u>耶路撒冷</u>、<u>犹太</u>和<u>约旦河</u>外的地区……大群的人相信<u>耶稣</u>并跟从<u>耶稣</u>。

Jesus’ ministry was in fact all around in all locations primarily centred in the Galilee region of northern Israel perhaps, and people from other locations all came to Jesus: Syria, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan… large crowds of people believed in Jesus and followed Jesus.

从事工的角度,我们看到<u>耶稣</u>如何向人们移动,人们如何向<u>耶稣</u>移动,以及人们如何与<u>耶稣</u>一起移动到其他地方去接触其他人。我相信神有他的理由和目的,将他所膏抹的人和他的天使派到正确的地点,那里的人需要看到神的光和神的爱。

For ministry we see how Jesus moved to people, how people moved to Jesus and how people moved with Jesus to other locations for other people. I am sure God has his reasons and purpose to send his anointed ones and his angels to the right locations where people are needing to see God’s light and God’s love.

你有没有想过为什么你出生在 Australia,或者为什么我们从母国被带到 Australia,我们现在都坐在 Moorabbin 的 St David’s,在 Melbourne 敬拜神。神的目的是什么,神的计划是什么?

Have you ever wondered why you were born in Australia, or why we were brought into Australia from our mother country, we are now all sitting here at St David’s in Moorabbin, in Melbourne to worship God. What is God’s purpose, what is God’s plan?

反思 Australia 的历史和多年来的变化,我们可以看到人们如何以各自的理由在 Australia Day 庆祝、反应或抗议。毫无疑问,Australia 是一个美丽的国家,一个充满机会的国家,一个拥有令人惊叹的景观和丰富自然资源的幸运国家。

Reflecting on the Australian history and changes over years, we may see how people celebrate, or react, or protest with their own reasons on Australia Day. No doubt about it, Australia is a beautiful country, a country of opportunity, a lucky country with stunning landscapes and abundant natural resources.

Australia 融合了其独特的原住民土著文化和现代多元文化,超过一半的人口在海外出生或有一位在海外出生的父母。超过200个国籍,超过300种语言被使用——是的,中国人除了普通话和粤语外还说许多不同的方言,还有大约120-170种原住民语言在所有不同的家庭中使用,我们可以想象 Australia 背景、思维方式、态度和信仰的多样性。

Australia is mixed with its unique indigenous aboriginal culture and the modern multicultural culture with over half the population born overseas or having an overseas-born parent. More than 200 nationalities, and over 300 languages are spoken—yes the Chinese speak many different dialects other than Mandarin and Cantonese, also there are around 120-170 indigenous languages spoken in all different homes, we can imagine the diverse backgrounds, mindset, attitudes and beliefs in Australia.

我们被呼召在一个充满差异和挑战、紧张和代际差距的广阔地区服事<u>基督</u>。Australia 的人口明显老龄化,老年 Australians 的人口比例意味着我们必须学习关怀、理解和尊重我们房屋周围的所有这些年长邻居,以及我们教会内的年长教友。利未记19:32,<u>摩西</u>说:“在白发的人面前,你要站起来;也要尊敬老人,又要敬畏你的神……”

We are called to serve Christ in a vast region of differences and challenges, tensions and generation gaps. Australia’s population is obviously aging, the demographic presence of older Australians, means we have to learn caring, understanding and honoring all these elderly neighbours around our houses, and older parishioners within our church. Leviticus 19:32, Moses said ‘Rise / stand up in the presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly and revere your God…’

我们说我们想吸引年轻人进入教会,但年轻人在观点、视角、经验和实践上与老年人有很大不同。想想前数字时代和后数字时代的对比。XYZ 世代可能充满活力但冲动,他们可能精力充沛但粗暴,有能力但不太可靠。

We say we like to attract young people into the church, but the young differs a lot from the old in views, in perspective, in experience, in practices. Think about the contrast of pre digital and the post digital eras. The generations XY Z can be vibrant but impulsive, they may be energetic but abrasive, capable but not too reliable.

后现代主义对抗现代主义,传统对抗创新,除了男人和女人、男性和女性之外,如今不断演变的关键类别是非二元性别、流动性别、无性别、泛性别、跨性别、性别酷儿。首字母缩写 LGBTQIA(女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别、酷儿/疑问、双性人、无性恋)可能是我们以前从未听说和理解过的东西。

Postmodernism against modernism, traditions against innovation, other than man and woman male and female, key evolving categories nowadays are non-binary, genderfluid, agender, pangender, transgender, genderqueer. The acronym LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/ questioning, intersex, asexual) could be something we have never heard and comprehended before.

婴儿潮一代和千禧一代说着两种不同的语言。年轻人和老年人实际上生活在两个不同的世界,那么我们如何能在<u>基督</u>里合一,我们应该如何在同一个教会里一起敬拜和服事<u>基督</u>……这是你们下一任牧师将要非常努力工作的事情。

Baby Boomers and millennials are speaking two different languages. The young and the old are literally living in two different worlds, so how can we be united in Christ and how should we worship and serve Christ together in the same church….. this is something your next vicar is going to work very hard on.

有人悲叹 Australia 处于动荡之中。分裂、差距、无序的民主、抗议反对抗议……混乱的地点、困惑的地点,但也是事工的地点……当<u>耶稣</u>看到人群,当<u>耶稣</u>看到动荡,他会再次表达他的怜悯,他会要求更多的工人进入收割的田地,进入宣教的田地。

Someone grieves Australia is in turmoil. The divisions, the gaps, the unruly democracy, the protests against protests… locations of chaos, locations of confusion, yet locations of ministry… as Jesus sees the crowds, as Jesus sees the turmoil, he would again express his compassion, he would ask for more workers to go into the harvest field, to go into the mission field.

在施洗<u>约翰</u>被监禁后,<u>耶稣</u>从南部地区<u>犹太</u>移动到北部地区<u>加利利</u>,以继续<u>约翰</u>留下的事工,以应验关于<u>弥赛亚</u>之光在<u>加利利</u>显现的预言。<u>以赛亚书</u>9:1 先知<u>以赛亚</u>预言说:“但那受过痛苦的,必不再见幽暗。从前神使<u>西布伦</u>地和<u>拿弗他利</u>地被藐视,末后却使这沿海的路,<u>约旦河</u>外,外邦人的<u>加利利</u>地得着荣耀。“在<u>耶稣</u>的时代,来自<u>加利利</u>、<u>西布伦</u>和<u>拿弗他利</u>的大群人……因跟从<u>耶稣</u>和接受<u>耶稣</u>的事工而蒙福。

Jesus moved from the southern area Judea to the northern area Galilee after John the Baptist’s imprisonment, as to continue John’s ministry left behind, as to fulfil the prophecy about the Messiah’s light dawning in Galilee. Isaiah 9:1 Prophet Isiah prophesied ‘Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he / God humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the gentiles…’ In Jesus time, large crowds from Galilee, Zebulun and Naphali… were blessed by following Jesus and receiving Jesus’ ministry.

随着时间的推移,在任何地点或每一个地点,事工只会变得越来越复杂和具有挑战性。我们准备好了吗,我们愿意站稳立场,但也在必要时妥协吗……主啊,怜悯我们。<u>基督</u>啊,怜悯我们。阿们。

As times go by, in any locations or in every location, ministry will only be getting more and more complicated and challenging. Are we prepared, are we willing to stand firm but also to compromise when necessary….. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Amen.

**阿们 | Amen**
