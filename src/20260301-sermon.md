The transfiguration of Jesus.
耶稣登山变像。

From the age of sixteen I did a lot of travelling, extensively across India with Youth For Christ, an organisation of outreach among young people in their teens and twenties.
从十六岁起，我就经常旅行，随“青年归主”（一个针对十几岁到二十几岁年轻人的布道组织）走遍了印度各地。

I travelled with groups of musicians, singers and guitarists and we would perform at various venues, churches, town halls and other auditoriums.
我与一群乐手、歌手和吉他手同行，在各种场所、教堂、市政厅和其他礼堂演出。

In 1975 I was a member of a team of six, and together we travelled through Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Ceylon, over a period of two months, so I gained a lot of experience travelling.
1975年，我是一个六人小组的成员，我们在两个月的时间里走遍了缅甸、泰国、马来西亚、新加坡和锡兰，因此我积累了丰富的旅行经验。

There was an evangelist who travelled with us, and he would preach to the young people and adults who attended.
有一位布道家与我们同行，他会向参加活动的年轻人和成年人讲道。

It was essentially a ministry of outreach to young people using the medium of modern Christian music.
这本质上是一个利用现代基督教音乐向年轻人开展的宣教事工。

All our programmes were planned and arranged to the minutest detail. People met us at the airports, provided hospitality and accommodation and driven everywhere, not a thing to worry about, and we got to enjoy delicious Chinese, Thai, Malaysian dishes, for free!
我们所有的行程都经过了最细致的计划和安排。有人在机场迎接我们，提供款待和住宿，并开车送我们去任何地方，完全不用担心任何事情，我们还免费享用了美味的中国菜、泰国菜和马来西亚菜！

Then I came to Australia in 1976, with a fair bit of travelling experience.
1976年，我带着相当丰富的旅行经验来到了澳大利亚。

The difference this time, I was travelling alone, a long way from home, about 5000 miles, into the great unknown.
这次的不同之处在于，我独自旅行，远离家乡约5000英里，走向那巨大的未知。

I travelled with Air India from Madras (Chennai) as it is now known which included a 52 hour stop over in Singapore before getting my connecting Qantas flight to Melbourne.
我从马德拉斯（现称钦奈）搭乘印度航空，其中包括在新加坡停留52小时，然后转乘澳洲航空的班机前往墨尔本。

I was put up in a 5 star hotel. It was all jolly good, but I was all by myself, in a strange place, strangers all around though everyone spoke English.
我被安排住在一家五星级酒店。一切都很美好，但我孑然一身，身处异地，周围全是陌生人，尽管大家都说英语。

Then I arrived in Melbourne, now here everything was new and different, I had to get used to the Aussie accent. It all took a bit of learning and adjusting to the food, which was very bland compared to spicy Indian cuisine, and climate and culture.
后来我抵达了墨尔本，这里的一切都是崭新且不同的，我必须习惯澳洲口音。这需要一些学习和适应，包括比起辛辣的印度料理显得非常清淡的食物，以及气候和文化。

However the people were friendly, kind and welcoming and it was not long before I settled in. I was a young man then and got on with my theological studies with confidence.
然而，这里的人们友好、善良且热情，不久我就安顿下来了。那时我还是个年轻人，满怀信心地开始了我的神学研究。

OT READING: it’s about Abraham’s travels, he lived in Mesopotamia amongst an ancient people, they were a polytheistic culture (worshipped many gods) and Abraham was happily settled there, after all it was his native land, culture, home, and all his relatives.
旧约经文：是关于亚伯拉罕的旅程。他住在美索不达米亚的古民族中，那是一个多神崇拜的文化，亚伯拉罕在那里安居乐业。毕竟，那是他的故土、文化、家园和他所有的亲人所在。

Abraham was also 75 years old.
亚伯拉罕当时也已经75岁了。

Then he became convinced that God had spoken to him, (not one of the many idols his people worshipped, but God, God almighty).
后来，他确信上帝对他说话了（不是他族人敬拜的众多偶像之一，而是上帝，全能的上帝）。

Genesis 12:1-4a
耶和华对亚伯兰说：“你要离开本地、亲族、父家，往我所要指示你的地去。我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你，叫你的名为大，你也要叫别人得福。为你祝福的，我必赐福与他；那咒诅你的，我必咒诅他。地上的万族都要因你得福。”亚伯兰就照着耶和华的吩咐去了；罗得也和他同去。亚伯兰出哈兰的时候年七十五岁。
The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran.

This God told Abraham to leave his land, home, relatives and culture and start walking, and He would lead him to a land eventually, once he started walking.
这位上帝告诉亚伯拉罕离开他的土地、家园、亲人和文化，开始行走；一旦他开始行走，上帝最终会领他到一块土地。

His destiny unknown, at 75 - well and truly retired, by today’s standards anyway.
他的命运未知，在75岁时——按今天的标准来看，这绝对是已经退休的年纪。

Abraham is recognised in Holy Scripture for his faith. He is revered as a man of great faith, by Jews, Christians and Muslims as a man of such faith, that he was prepared to follow God into an unknown future, leaving all that was familiar and secure, taking God at his word, implicitly trusting him and obeying His call.
亚伯拉罕因其信心而被载入圣经。他被犹太教徒、基督徒和穆斯林尊崇为一个拥有伟大使命感的人，他准备好跟随上帝进入未知的未来，离开所有熟悉和安全的事物，信守上帝的话语，绝对地信任祂并顺服祂的呼召。

Till God brought him to Canaan, the promised land and he settled there. On his way there he passed through Shechem and Bethel, and at both these places he had a Theophany or vision of God, where he built an altar and worshipped the Lord, he acknowledged God in this particular way, built an altar and worshiped God.
直到上帝带他到迦南——应许之地，他在那里定居。在前往那里的途中，他经过了示剑和伯特利，在这两个地方他都有过神显（上帝的显现）或异象，他在那里筑了一座坛敬拜耶和华；他以这种特殊的方式承认上帝，筑坛并敬拜上帝。

Abraham’s life was a journey, a journey of faith into the unknown, as far as he was concerned, but known to God, who had called him, with a purpose.
亚伯拉罕的一生是一段旅程，对他而言，是一段进入未知的信心之旅，但对于呼召他并怀有心意的上帝来说，那是已知的。

Abraham’s only requirement was to trust, obey and follow. That was the nature Abraham’s calling and life long journey.
亚伯拉罕唯一的使命就是信任、顺服和跟随。这就是亚伯拉罕呼召和终身旅程的本质。

What Abraham did at 75 years of age, making a complete break with his past and stepping out into the unknown is an inspiration to all elderly and aging people.
亚伯拉罕在75岁时所做的——彻底告别过去，步入未知——对所有老年人和步入老龄的人来说都是一种鼓舞。

For many, if not most of us the fact, that they are approaching their 70’s and 80’s, can be a very demoralising prospect. They may even feel they are a different species, no longer needed, or quite belonging to the human race.
对于许多人（如果不是大多数人的话）来说，面对即将进入七八十岁的事实，可能是一个非常令人沮丧的前景。他们甚至可能觉得自己是另一个物种，不再被需要，或者不再完全属于人类。

Tiredness and declining health and energy, can be a trap, combined with loneliness can give way to fear anxiety and dread.
疲劳、健康状况下降和精力减退可能成为一个陷阱，再加上孤独，会产生恐惧、焦虑和不安。

Abraham is the Patron Saint of the elderly and aging.
亚伯拉罕是老年人和步入老龄者的守护圣徒。

The Old Testament Patriarch at 75 chose new life, new purpose, new vision and a new hope.
这位旧约先祖在75岁时选择了新的生命、新的目标、新的异象和新的希望。

Old age to Abraham was not a disaster, but a new challenge, not full of death, but full of life, not filled with FATE, but filled with Faith.
对亚伯拉罕来说，晚年不是一场灾难，而是一个新的挑战；不是充满了死亡，而是充满了生命；不是充满了“宿命”，而是充满了“信心”。

As we travel through life let us reflect on Abraham’s example, God speaks to us and calls us to look to him, to trust him and allow him to lead us and accomplish his purposes for us, in us and through us, in our lifelong journey.
当我们走过人生旅途时，让我们反思亚伯拉罕的榜样。上帝向我们说话，呼召我们仰望祂、信任祂，并允许祂在我们的终身旅程中带领我们，在我们身上、通过我们成就祂对我们的旨意。

Gospel for today: This reading is about another journey. This time, Jesus takes three of his disciples Mountain Climbing, this time it is not a horizontal ——— kind of journey, it is an uphill ^ kind of journey.
今日福音：这段经文关乎另一段旅程。这一次，耶稣带着他的三个门徒去登山。这一次，这不是一种水平式的（———）旅程，而是一种向上的（^）旅程。

Jesus led them up a high mountain, with a purpose. He was revealed to them in a new and totally different light, in his full divine glory. Jesus was transfigured (a vision) before them, Matthew writes, ‘his face was shining like the sun’ and his clothes were dazzling white’!
耶稣带着目的领他们上了一座高山。祂在一种全新的、完全不同的光中向他们显现，展现了祂完全的神圣荣耀。耶稣在他们面前变了形象（一个异象），马太写道：“脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白放光。”

Matthew 17:1-9
过了六天，耶稣带着彼得、雅各和雅各的兄弟约翰暗暗地上了高山，就在他们面前变了形象，脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白放光。忽然，有摩西、以利亚向他们显现，同耶稣说话。彼得对耶稣说：“主啊，我们在这里真好！你若愿意，我就在这里搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”说话之间，忽然有一朵光明的云彩遮盖他们，且有声音从云彩里出来说：“这是我的爱子，我所喜悦的，你们要听他！”门徒听见，就俯伏在地，极其害怕。耶稣进前来，摸他们，说：“起来，不要害怕。”他们举目不见一人，只见耶稣在那里。下山的时候，耶稣吩咐他们说：“人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。”
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!” When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.” When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”

Have you ever tried looking directly at the sun, not possible, it is blinding!
你有没有试过直视太阳？那是不可能的，会照得人眼瞎！

It was a transcendent experience, a mountain top experience, an encounter with God, as God. A wonderful vision of God, when the curtain was drawn aside, to see him as he really is.
这是一种超越的体验，一种“山顶”的体验，一种作为受造物与上帝的邂逅。这是一个奇妙的上帝异象，当帷幕被拉开，人们看到了祂真实的模样。

And the two all time greats of the Old Testament, Moses (the law giver) and Elijah, the greatest of the Old Testament prophets, were talking with Jesus.
旧约时代最伟大的两位人物：摩西（颁布律法者）和以利亚（旧约最伟大的先知），正在与耶稣交谈。

Peter starts making a speech, “Lord how good it is that we are here! If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
彼得开始发表言论：“主啊，我们在这里真好！你若愿意，我就在这里搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。”

Yes the transfiguration vision was just about wasted on them! Peter, instead of taking taking it in, soaking it up, was distracted. Peter was distracted by irrelevant trivialities, Peter was thinking about erecting three monuments, one for Jesus, one for Moses and one for Elijah, even in the midst of a divine revelation, a face to face encounter with God almighty.
是的，变像的异象几乎在他们身上浪费了！彼得没有去领悟、去沉浸其中，反而分心了。彼得被无关紧要的琐事分了心，彼得正想着建造三座纪念碑——一座给耶稣，一座给摩西，一座给以利亚，即便当时正处于神圣的启示之中，正与全能的上帝面对面。

It is so easy to be distracted, even in the midst of divine revelation, an encounter with God, a sublime heavenly experience, by shifting our focus on to irrelevant trivialities and distractions.
我们很容易分心，即使是在神圣的启示、与上帝的邂逅、崇高的属天体验中，也会因为将注意力转移到无关紧要的琐事和干扰上而分心。

When God gives us these mountain top experiences of himself, we must focus on them, stay with them, such precious moments are rare, our Mountain top experiences.
当上帝赐予我们这些关于祂自己的山顶体验时，我们必须专注其中，留在其中。这种宝贵的时刻是罕见的，那是属于我们的“山顶”时刻。

It could be in the midst of our regular Sunday worship, during singing hymns, hearing a scripture reading, during the sermon, or peace greeting, while receiving the Sacrament of Holy Communion, or even in a quiet time at home or in the garden. They are precious opportunities and rare, our mountain top experiences.
它可能发生在常规的主日崇拜中：在唱赞美诗时、在听经文朗读时、在讲道中、在问安礼时、在领受圣餐时，甚至是在家里或花园里的安静时光。这些都是珍贵且罕见的机会，是我们的山顶体验。

When we feel the presence of God and praise, prayer and worship, wells up from deep within like a fountain.
当我们感受到上帝的同在，赞美、祷告和敬拜便会像泉水一样从内心深处涌出。

It is important to recognise these moments of divine encounter, for that is what they are, and not allow ourselves to be distracted by trivialities (the kids and grandkids are coming home for dinner, will I be able to get the roast done in time, whose going to set the table and do the dishes after the meal?)
识别这些与神邂逅的时刻至关重要，因为那正是它们的本质；不要让自己被琐事分心（比如：孩子和孙子要回家吃晚饭，我能准时做好烤肉吗？谁来摆餐具？饭后谁来洗碗？）。

It is important to recognise these special moments of divine encounter and not allow ourselves to be distracted by trivialities.
识别这些特殊的与神邂逅的时刻很重要，不要让我们自己被琐事分心。

Such moments are very special gifts from God, to strengthen, help and equip us for our life’s journey.
这些时刻是上帝赐予的非常特殊的礼物，目的是为了加强、帮助和装备我们去走人生的旅程。

Then we must also come down from the Mountain Top experience to again live life on the plain or even in the valley of the shadow of death, but we come down, strengthened and encouraged to persevere along life’s journey.
然后，我们也必须从山顶的体验中走下来，再次在平原上、甚至在死荫的幽谷中生活。但我们下山时，已经获得了力量和鼓舞，能够在人生的旅途中坚持下去。

Our earthly journey is a lifelong journey, being led by God like Abraham into the unknown, willing to follow him, in faith, trust and obedience, this can be an adventure in which God proves His faithfulness, to those who seek him.
我们的世俗之旅是一段终身的旅程，像亚伯拉罕一样被上帝领入未知，愿意以信心、信任和顺服跟随祂。这可以成为一段冒险，在这段冒险中，上帝向寻求祂的人证明了祂的信实。

During this lifelong journey, from time to time, he takes us aside, to do some mountain climbing to give us a brilliant vision of his presence with us in a very special way, such that it inspires and assures us, that we are not alone and that God the creator and Lord of heaven and earth is with us.
在这一生的旅途中，祂不时地带我们到一旁，去爬爬山，以一种非常特殊的方式让我们看到祂与我们同在的光辉景象，从而激励并向我们保证：我们并不孤单，上帝——天地万物的创造者和主——与我们同在。

We praise God for the way He led Abraham forward, and Peter, James and John upwards, and in both journeys, He makes Himself known to us.
我们赞美上帝，因为祂带领亚伯拉罕前行，带领彼得、雅各和约翰向上攀登。在这两段旅程中，祂都向我们彰显了祂自己。
