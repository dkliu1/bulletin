* 路加福音 16:1-13

* Luke 16:1-13

[1-2]

English:
Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’

中文：
耶稣对门徒说：“有一个财主的管家，有人向他主人告他浪费主人的财物。主人叫他来，对他说：‘我听见你这事怎么样呢？把你所经管的交代明白，因为你不能再作我的管家。’

[3-4]

English:
The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg— I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’

中文：
那管家心里说：‘主人辞我，不用我再作管家，我将来做什么呢？锄地无力，讨饭怕羞。我知道怎么行，好叫人在我不作管家之后接我到他们家里去。’

[5-7]

English:
So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied.
The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’
Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’
‘A thousand bushels of wheat,’ he replied.
He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’

中文：
于是，他将欠他主人债的，一个一个地叫了来，问头一个说：‘你欠我主人多少？’
他说：‘一百篓油。’管家说：‘拿你的账，快坐下写五十。’
又问一个说：‘你欠多少？’他说：‘一百石麦子。’管家说：‘拿你的账，写八十。’

[8-9]

English:
The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

中文：
主人就夸奖这不义的管家做事聪明。因为今世之子，在世事之上，较比光明之子更加聪明。我又告诉你们：要借着那不义的钱财结交朋友，到钱财无用的时候，他们可以接你们到永存的帐幕里去。

[10-12]

English:
Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?

中文：
人在最小的事上忠心，在大事上也忠心；在最小的事上不义，在大事上也不义。倘若你们在不义的钱财上不忠心，谁还把那真实的钱财托付你们呢？倘若你们在别人的东西上不忠心，谁还把你们自己的东西给你们呢？

[13]

English:
“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”

中文：
“一个仆人不能事奉两个主；不是恶这个爱那个，就是重这个轻那个。你们不能又事奉神，又事奉玛门。”

Sermon Illustration / 讲道例证
Lord Mengchang 孟尝君的故事

English:
Let me start with a real story about a rich influential noble in Chinese history around 300 BC. Lord Mengchang was known for his incredible generosity. He would provide food, shelter, and clothing for everyone who sought his protection, regardless of their social status or usefulness...

中文：
让我先讲一个发生在公元前约300年的中国历史故事。孟尝君是一位富有且有影响力的贵族，他以非凡的慷慨著称。他为所有寻求庇护的人提供食物、住处和衣物，不论他们的社会地位或是否有用……

（他供养了三千门客，慷慨的善行不仅赢得了感激，也形成了一支“私人军队”和智囊团，使他声名远扬，政治地位超越众多诸侯。）

Jim Elliot 的话

English:
Philip James Elliot, an American Christian missionary, said this and is frequently quoted: He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.

中文：
美国宣教士艾略特曾说过一句常被引用的话：“那把自己不能保留的东西舍去，以得着不能失去的东西的人，并不是愚昧的。”

孟尝君正是借着舍去自己多余的钱财，换取友谊、名声和道德的遗产。

Kingdom Economy 天国的经济学

English:
The Kingdom economy tells us exactly that we have to work out the best value and the best meaning of what we are doing each day...

中文：
天国的经济提醒我们：每天所做的事，要寻求最大的价值和最深的意义……

（主夸奖那不义的管家，不是因他不义，而是因他做事精明。精明就是在特殊处境下能作出正确智慧的决定。）

Application 应用

English:
It is better to make friends than to make enemies. It is better to build a good reputation than to build a good fortune. It is better to leave a legacy of noble moral and spiritual character, than to leave just an inheritance of money and properties.

中文：
交朋友总比树敌好；建立好名声总比积攒财富好；留下一份高尚的道德与属灵遗产，总比仅仅留下金钱和产业更好。

Jesus’ Commission 耶稣的差遣

English:
Jesus said in Matthew 10:16: I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.

中文：
耶稣在《马太福音》10:16说：“我差你们去，如同羊进入狼群，所以你们要灵巧像蛇，驯良像鸽子。”

（世界危险，充满欺骗；基督徒更当有智慧，知道什么才有永恒价值。）

God’s Will 神的心意

English:
Our God can never be mean nor cruel... Paul says in 1 Timothy 2:4 that Jesus wants everyone to be saved. Peter says in 2 Peter 3:9 that the Lord is patient... so that no one would perish.

中文：
我们的神绝不会吝啬或残酷……保罗在《提摩太前书》2:4说，耶稣愿意万人得救；彼得在《彼得后书》3:9说，主不愿有一人沉沦，乃愿人人都悔改。

A Shrewd Christian 一个精明的基督徒

English:
A shrewd Christian should be honest and accountable. A shrewd Christian should be trustworthy and reliable. All wealth and assets belong to God; we are only trustees and caretakers...

中文：
一个精明的基督徒应当诚实负责，应当忠心可靠。所有财富和产业都属于神，我们只是受托的管家……

（当我们见主时，祂不会称赞我们赚了多少，而是称赞我们为祂的国度舍去了多少时间、金钱与精力。）

Serving One Master 事奉一位主

English:
In Jesus’ time, a slave could only belong to one master exclusively... When we choose to serve God, every moment of our time, every atom of our energy belongs to Him.

中文：
在耶稣的年代，一个奴仆只能属于一个主人……当我们选择事奉神，我们的每一刻时光、每一分精力都归祂所有。

Conclusion 结论

English:
May God help us all to be shrewd, faithful and loyal to him and him alone. Amen!

中文：
愿上帝帮助我们都能有智慧、忠心，并且单单忠于祂。阿们
