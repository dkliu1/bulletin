上周二，1月6日，在教会年历中是主显节（Epiphany），这是基督向外邦人显现或启示的节日——也就是三位博士来到婴孩耶稣面前的日子。  
Last Tuesday, January 6, in the church’s calendar, was the Feast of the Epiphany, the manifestation or revelation of Christ to the Gentiles—the coming of the three wise men to the infant Jesus.

而就在今天，主显节后的主日——我们所指定的经文阅读在时间上一下子向前跳跃了三十年，来到耶稣受洗的时刻。  
And already today, the Sunday after Epiphany, our appointed Scripture readings make a chronological leap forward of thirty years to the baptism of Jesus.

四福音书中，没有一位作者为我们记载耶稣从出生到三十岁受洗之间的岁月，只有路加是个例外。他记述了十二岁的耶稣随父母上耶路撒冷圣殿的故事——当时耶稣因专心与殿里的学者讨论对话而被“落下”。  
None of the Gospel writers records anything for us about the intervening years between Jesus’ birth and his baptism at the age of thirty, with the exception of Luke, who alone tells us of the visit to the temple by the boy Jesus at the age of twelve—when he was left behind because he was so engrossed in discussion and dialogue with the scholars in the temple.

马利亚和约瑟十分着急，以为他走失了。  
Mary and Joseph were worried, thinking he was lost.

但随着这个充满洞见的叙述展开，我们发现，他并不是在圣殿里迷失了自己——事实上，他正开始认识真正的自己。  
But as that insightful narrative unfolds, we discover that he did not so much lose himself in the temple—in fact, he began to find himself.

“为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗？”他显然并没有迷失。  
“Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” He certainly was not lost.

耶稣在三十岁时开始了他的公开事奉。在此之前，他只是当地的一名木匠。  
Jesus was thirty years of age when he began his public ministry. Up to that point, he was the local carpenter.

我们不禁要问：他为什么等了这么久？毕竟他只剩下三年的时间，为什么如此迟才开始他一生真正的工作？  
We wonder why he waited so long. After all, he had only three years left—so why did he leave it so late to begin the real work of his life?

他为什么把时间花在做铁锹把、修理车轮，或做那个时代乡村木匠所做的各种事情上？  
Why did he spend his time making handles for spades, repairing cart wheels, or doing whatever village carpenters of that time did?

若将我们主生命中的前三十年视为无足轻重，甚至是浪费，那是错误的。  
It would be wrong to write off the first thirty years of our Lord’s life as of little account, or even as a waste.

在那些年里，他是在等候——但他在做什么呢？这就好像问：一粒种子从春天到秋天之间在做什么？  
During those years he was waiting—but what was he doing? It is like asking what a seed is doing between spring and autumn.

它在生长、成熟、结实。（芒果种子——我最喜欢的水果之一。）耶稣也是如此。  
It is growing, maturing, ripening (a mango seed—one of my favourite fruits). So it was with Jesus.

圣路加在记述十二岁耶稣的故事结尾处，也确认了这一点。  
St Luke confirms this at the end of the episode of the twelve-year-old Jesus.

“耶稣的智慧和身量，并神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。”这是对我们主作为一个完整之人的成长的描述，强调了他生命中的心智、身体、属灵和社会层面。  
“And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.” This refers to our Lord’s development as a whole person, emphasising the mental, physical, spiritual, and social dimensions of his life.

人们或许能在体育、商业、事业、政治等许多领域取得卓越成就，却在生命的其他方面严重缺失。  
People may achieve excellence in many endeavours—sports, business, careers, politics—yet fall miserably short in other aspects of life.

耶稣是真正完全的人——“耶稣的智慧和身量，并神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。”  
Jesus was the truly complete human being—“He grew in wisdom and stature and in favour with God and man.”

耶稣受约翰施洗的那一天，从某种意义上说，是他生命中最重要的一天。  
The day on which Jesus was baptised by John was, in a sense, the most important day of his life.

那是一个作出抉择的日子，是他回应呼召的日子——一个在他内心越来越强烈的呼召。  
It was a day of decision-making. It was a day on which he answered a call—a call that had been growing stronger and stronger within him.

“当下，耶稣从加利利来到约旦河，见了约翰，要受他的洗。”我们看到此刻的耶稣——果断、有目标、有方向。是时候开始他一直为之预备的事工了。  
“Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptised by him.” We see Jesus now—decisive, purposeful, intentional. It was time to begin what he had been prepared for.

生命中有许多等候的时刻，但我们不能只是坐着等待事情发生。  
Life calls for a lot of waiting. But we cannot simply sit and wait for something to happen.

在等候的同时，我们必须去做眼前的事，去完成当下需要完成的工作。凡你手所当做的事，就当去做。  
In the meantime, we must do what is in front of us now, that which needs doing now. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it.

如果我们正从事的是一份微小或不显眼的工作呢？这并没有关系，它仍然会给我们成长的机会。  
What if we are involved in some small or obscure task? It makes no difference. It will still give us an opportunity to grow.

耶稣是一名木匠——有时我们倾向于把生命分成“神圣的”和“世俗的”。  
Jesus was a carpenter—sometimes we are inclined to divide life into the sacred and the secular.

然而，从我们主的经历来看，当我们意识到神参与生命的每一个层面时，即使是世俗的，也会成为神圣的。  
Yet in the light of our Lord’s experience, even the secular, when approached with the consciousness that God is involved in all of life, becomes sacred.

因此，我们不能把生命的任何一部分视为无用，也不能把任何经历看作浪费，无论它多么艰难。  
We really cannot write off any part of our lives as useless, or any experience as wasted, no matter how difficult.

所以，我们要对自己和他人有耐心。人们成长的速度各不相同，每个人都需要被给予足够的时间。  
So we must be patient with ourselves and with others. People develop at different rates. Each individual must be given as much time as necessary.

### 耶稣的洗礼与我们的洗礼  
### Jesus’ Baptism and Ours

今天，我们纪念耶稣的洗礼，这也给了我们机会反思自己的洗礼。  
Today we remember the baptism of Jesus, which, among other things, gives us the opportunity to reflect upon our own baptisms.

我们的洗礼使我们与基督联合，而他的洗礼也使他与我们联合——这是保罗在《罗马书》中的论述。  
Our baptism unites us to Christ, and his baptism unites him to us—this is St Paul’s argument in Romans.

“所以我们借着洗礼归入死，和他一同埋葬，原是叫我们一举一动有新生的样式，像基督借着父的荣耀从死里复活一样。”（罗马书 6:4）  
“Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead … we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4)

这两者是不可分割的，我们不能只思想其中之一。  
We cannot think of the one without the other.

因此，当我们庆祝在约旦河为我们成就的一切时，也必须省察自己：我们的生命是否与洗礼中所应许的那种彻底更新相称？  
So just as we must celebrate what has been done for us at the Jordan, we must also ask ourselves how our lives measure up to the radical newness pledged in baptism.

尼撒的贵格利（Gregory of Nyssa，四世纪主教，被称为“加帕多家三教父”之一，是《尼西亚信经》形成中的关键人物）超越洗礼仪式本身，注目于随后必须出现的更新生命。  
Gregory of Nyssa (a fourth-century bishop, and one of the three Cappadocian Fathers, a key figure in the formulation of the Nicene Creed) looked beyond the ritual of baptism to the changed life that must follow.

在教会初期，基督徒认为洗礼会给一个人的生命带来戏剧性的改变。  
In those early centuries, Christians saw baptism as resulting in dramatic change in a person’s life.

在罗马地下墓穴中有关基督徒洗礼的一些图画，生动地表达了这一点：受洗的人全都被描绘成孩子。  
This is strikingly represented in some of the drawings of Christian baptism in the Roman catacombs, where those baptised are all depicted as children.

其含义是：洗礼是真正的新生，是重新开始。  
The idea is that baptism is truly a new birth, a starting over.

耶稣对尼哥底母说，人若不重生，就不能见神的国——而尼哥底母却误以为是要再回到母腹中。  
Jesus said to Nicodemus that one cannot see the kingdom of God without being born again—a declaration Nicodemus misunderstood as crawling back into the womb.

从地下墓穴的记载中我们发现，许多早期基督徒是从受洗之日开始计算自己的年龄。  
Many early Christians, as we discover from the catacombs, counted their age from their baptism.

有些墓葬中虽然是成年人的遗骨，却标注其年龄为个位数。  
There are burials with adult bones that declare the age of the deceased to be in single digits.

他们对洗礼意义的确信如此强烈，以至于过去的一切都算不得什么，认识基督才是一切。  
So powerful was their conviction of the significance of baptism that their past was as nothing—knowing Christ was everything.

一个人受洗的日子，比被按立为司祭或主教的日子还要重要。  
The day when a person was baptised was considered more important than the day when a person is ordained priest or bishop.

据说，法国国王路易九世签署文件时，并不写“国王路易九世”，而是写“普瓦西的路易”。  
Louis IX of France, it is said, used to sign his documents not “Louis IX, King,” but “Louis of Poissy.”

有人问他原因，他回答说：“普瓦西是我受洗的地方。我更看重我受洗的地方，而不是我加冕的兰斯大教堂。作神的儿女，比作一个国家的统治者更伟大；后者在我死时会失去，而前者却是我进入永恒荣耀的通行证。”  
When asked why, he answered, “Poissy is the place where I was baptised. I think more of the place where I was baptised than of Rheims Cathedral where I was crowned. It is a greater thing to be a child of God than to be the ruler of a kingdom: this last I shall lose at death, but the other will be my passport to an everlasting glory.”

“要给这孩子起什么名字？”这是洗礼礼仪中的问题，随后孩子被赋予他的基督徒名字。  
“What name shall be given to this child?” is the question asked in the Service of Baptism. The child is then given his or her Christian name.

命名的那一刻是神圣的，因为它提醒我们：在教会告诉我们是谁之前，我们并没有真正的名字和身份。  
The moment of naming is holy, for it reminds us that none of us has a name—an identity—until the Church tells us who we are.

在洗礼中，教会宣告：你是一个被赐予名字的人——基督徒。  
In baptism the Church says: You are someone to whom a name has been given—Christian.

你是一个有身份的人——在耶稣基督里作神的仆人。  
You are someone who has an identity—a servant of God in Jesus Christ.

以下是一首洗礼圣诗中的几句：  
A couple of verses from one of our Baptism Hymns:

“我们赞美你，主啊，如今这孩子  
已接在真葡萄树上，  
成为你家中的一员，  
并以十字架为记号。  

求你用天上的恩典膏抹我，  
并将我印证为你所有，  
使我得见你荣耀的面，  
在你宝座前敬拜。”  

Today, our Lord’s baptism reminds us that in baptism we are given a崇高而奇妙的呼召——在基督里进入新生命，过更新的生活。  
Today our Lord’s baptism reminds us that ours is a high and wonderful calling in baptism, which calls us to new life and new living in Christ.

我愿以一段祷告作为结束：  
I would like to conclude with a prayer:

“父啊，我们感谢你借着洗礼的恩典，使我们成为你的儿女。  
求你帮助我们在日常生活中活出这恩典，  
以儿女般的信靠来亲近你，  
并借着我们的生命，成为你爱与和平的见证。  
奉我主耶稣基督的名求，阿们。”  
“Father, we thank you for the grace of baptism which makes us your children.  
Help us to live it out in our daily lives by showing you the trust of a child,  
and by becoming representatives of your love and peace,  
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.”
